For [fraction numerator=1 denominator=2]one half[/fraction] to be accurate, both parts must be exactly the same size. Look at this bar - one part is much larger than the other. They're unequal, so this can't show [fraction numerator=1 denominator=2]one half[/fraction]. That's why all parts need to be equal for fractions."
