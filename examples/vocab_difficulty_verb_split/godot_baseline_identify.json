For [fraction numerator=1 denominator=6]one sixth[/fraction], we need exactly 6 equal parts. The top bar has unequal parts - see how some are bigger? The bottom bar also has unequal parts. But the middle bar has all 6 parts the same size, making it [fraction numerator=1 denominator=6]one sixth[/fraction]. That's how sixths work - all parts must be equal."
