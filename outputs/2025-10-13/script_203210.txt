PROBLEM 1:  / CREATE / PROCEDURAL
âš« Guide: "Let's figure out how to split this rectangle into 4 equal parts."

ðŸ”µ Visual: [CLEAR] A horizontal rectangle with light grid overlay showing possible division lines

âš« Guide: "Draw lines to divide it into 4 parts that are the same size."

ðŸ”µ Visual: [CLEAR] Rectangle with grid guides active for drawing

Prompt: Draw division lines on the rectangle

âš« Guide: "Now shade one of the 4 equal parts."

ðŸ”µ Visual: [PARTITIONED] Rectangle divided into 4 equal vertical sections

Prompt: Click to shade one section

[Student attempts]

SUCCESS PATH:
âš« Guide: "You divided it into equal parts. Good work."
âš« Guide: "Right there - each part is the same size."

PROBLEM 2:  / CREATE / PROCEDURAL
âš« Guide: "Check this out. This circle is split into equal pieces."

ðŸ”µ Visual: [SHADED] Circle divided into 6 equal wedges with one wedge shaded blue

âš« Guide: "Count how many equal pieces there are total."

ðŸ”µ Visual: [SHADED] Circle divided into 6 equal wedges with one wedge shaded blue

Prompt: Type the number of total pieces

âš« Guide: "The shaded part is 1 piece out of 6 total pieces. Which fraction shows that?"

ðŸ”µ Visual: [SHADED] Circle divided into 6 equal wedges with one wedge shaded blue
ðŸ”µ Visual: [UNSELECTED] Button showing 1/6
ðŸ”µ Visual: [UNSELECTED] Button showing 1/5
ðŸ”µ Visual: [UNSELECTED] Button showing 6/1
ðŸ”µ Visual: [UNSELECTED] Button showing 1/2

Prompt: Select the correct fraction

[Student attempts]

SUCCESS PATH:
âš« Guide: "Six pieces total - you counted carefully."
âš« Guide: "Right there - you got how fractions work. The bottom number shows total pieces."

PROBLEM 3:  / CREATE / PROCEDURAL
âš« Guide: "Maria says each piece is 1/3 of the whole sandwich. Let's figure out what that means."

ðŸ”µ Visual: [DISPLAY ONLY] Large display showing 1/3

âš« Guide: "The bottom number shows how many equal pieces total. How many pieces did Maria cut?"

ðŸ”µ Visual: [DISPLAY ONLY] Display showing 1/3 with bottom number highlighted

Prompt: Type the number of pieces

âš« Guide: "Good. Now look at these sandwiches. Find the one cut into 3 equal pieces."

ðŸ”µ Visual: [DIVIDED 2 EQUAL] Sandwich divided into 2 equal horizontal pieces
ðŸ”µ Visual: [DIVIDED 3 EQUAL] Sandwich divided into 3 equal horizontal pieces
ðŸ”µ Visual: [DIVIDED 4 EQUAL] Sandwich divided into 4 equal horizontal pieces
ðŸ”µ Visual: [DIVIDED 3 UNEQUAL] Sandwich divided into 3 unequal pieces
ðŸ”µ Visual: [CLEAR] Empty box labeled 'Maria's sandwich'

Prompt: Drag the correct sandwich to the box

[Student attempts]

SUCCESS PATH:
âš« Guide: "You read the bottom number - that's solid math thinking."
âš« Guide: "You found it. Three equal pieces, just like the fraction shows."
