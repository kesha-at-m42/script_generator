# Problem 1: Partition

**Learning Goal:** Students can partition shapes into equal parts
**Difficulty Level:** 1
**Total Steps:** 3

---

## Step 1

**Tutor says:**
> Here's a rectangle. Your job is to divide it into 4 equal parts.

**Visual elements shown:**
- [horizontal_rectangle_bar] State: `empty` - Blank rectangle, 4 inches wide, 2 inches tall


## Step 2

**Tutor says:**
> Draw lines to split the rectangle into 4 parts that are exactly the same size.

**Student action:**
- Draw partition lines on the rectangle

**Visual elements shown:**
- [horizontal_rectangle_bar] State: `empty_interactive` - Rectangle ready for student to draw partition lines

**Expected student input:** draw_lines


## Step 3

**Tutor says:**
> Now shade in one of the 4 equal parts.

**Student action:**
- Click to shade one part

**Visual elements shown:**
- [horizontal_rectangle_bar] State: `partitioned_4_equal` - Rectangle divided into 4 equal vertical sections

**Expected student input:** click_section


## Expected Final State

After completing all steps, the visual should show:

- **horizontal_rectangle_bar:** `partitioned_4_equal_shaded_1` - Rectangle divided into 4 equal parts with one section shaded

## Success Feedback

1. You divided it into equal parts. Good work.
2. Right there - you shaded exactly one fourth.
