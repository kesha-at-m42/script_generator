## Step 1

**Tutor says:**
> Check this out. This circle is split into equal parts.

**Visual elements shown:**
- [circle] State: `divided_6_equal_shaded_1` - Circle divided into 6 equal wedges with one wedge shaded


## Step 2

**Tutor says:**
> Count the total parts in the circle.

**Student action:**
- How many equal parts? Click the number.

**Visual elements shown:**
- [circle] State: `divided_6_equal_shaded_1` - Circle divided into 6 equal wedges with one wedge shaded
- [number_button] State: `options_3_4_5_6` - Four number buttons showing 3, 4, 5, 6

**Expected student input:** click_number


## Step 3

**Tutor says:**
> The bottom number in a fraction shows how many equal parts in the whole. The top number shows how many parts are shaded.

**Visual elements shown:**
- [circle] State: `divided_6_equal_shaded_1` - Circle with 6 parts, 1 shaded


## Step 4

**Tutor says:**
> Which fraction represents the shaded part?

**Student action:**
- Select the correct fraction

**Visual elements shown:**
- [circle] State: `divided_6_equal_shaded_1` - Circle divided into 6 equal wedges with one wedge shaded
- [multiple_choice_buttons] State: `four_options` - A) 1/3  B) 1/6  C) 1/5  D) 6/1

**Expected student input:** click_choice


## Expected Final State

After completing all steps, the visual should show:

- **circle:** `divided_6_equal_shaded_1` - Circle divided into 6 equal wedges with one wedge shaded
- **multiple_choice_buttons:** `B_selected_correct` - Option B (1/6) selected and marked correct

## Success Feedback

1. You counted all 6 parts.
2. Right there - you matched the fraction to what you see. One shaded part out of 6 total.
