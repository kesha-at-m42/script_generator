# Problem 1: Partition | Confidence

**Goal:** Students can partition shapes into equal parts

---

âš« **Guide:** "Let's figure out how to split this rectangle into 4 equal parts."

ðŸ”µ **Visual:** A horizontal rectangle with light grid overlay showing possible division lines


âš« **Guide:** "Draw lines to divide it into 4 parts that are the same size."

ðŸ”µ **Visual:** Rectangle with grid guides active for drawing

[Draw division lines on the rectangle]


âš« **Guide:** "Now shade one of the 4 equal parts."

ðŸ”µ **Visual:** Rectangle divided into 4 equal vertical sections

[Click to shade one section]

# Problem 2: Identify | Baseline

**Goal:** Students can identify unit fractions

---

âš« **Guide:** "Check this out. This circle is split into equal pieces."

ðŸ”µ **Visual:** Circle divided into 6 equal wedges with one wedge shaded blue


âš« **Guide:** "Count how many equal pieces there are total."

ðŸ”µ **Visual:** Circle divided into 6 equal wedges with one wedge shaded blue

[Type the number of total pieces]


âš« **Guide:** "The shaded part is 1 piece out of 6 total pieces. Which fraction shows that?"

ðŸ”µ **Visual:** Circle divided into 6 equal wedges with one wedge shaded blue
ðŸ”µ **Visual:** Button showing 1/6
ðŸ”µ **Visual:** Button showing 1/5
ðŸ”µ **Visual:** Button showing 6/1
ðŸ”µ **Visual:** Button showing 1/2

[Select the correct fraction]

# Problem 3: Apply | Stretch

**Goal:** Students can partition shapes into equal parts and identify unit fractions

---

âš« **Guide:** "Maria says each piece is 1/3 of the whole sandwich. Let's figure out what that means."

ðŸ”µ **Visual:** Large display showing 1/3


âš« **Guide:** "The bottom number shows how many equal pieces total. How many pieces did Maria cut?"

ðŸ”µ **Visual:** Display showing 1/3 with bottom number highlighted

[Type the number of pieces]


âš« **Guide:** "Good. Now look at these sandwiches. Find the one cut into 3 equal pieces."

ðŸ”µ **Visual:** Sandwich divided into 2 equal horizontal pieces
ðŸ”µ **Visual:** Sandwich divided into 3 equal horizontal pieces
ðŸ”µ **Visual:** Sandwich divided into 4 equal horizontal pieces
ðŸ”µ **Visual:** Sandwich divided into 3 unequal pieces
ðŸ”µ **Visual:** Empty box labeled 'Maria's sandwich'

[Drag the correct sandwich to the box]
