# Problem 1: Partition

**Goal:** Students can partition shapes into equal parts
**Difficulty:** 1

---

**Guide:** "Let's figure out how to split this rectangle into 4 equal parts."

**Visual:**
- A horizontal rectangle with light grid overlay showing possible division lines


**Guide:** "Draw lines to divide it into 4 parts that are the same size."

**Student Action:** Draw division lines on the rectangle

**Visual:**
- Rectangle with grid guides active for drawing


**Guide:** "Now shade one of the 4 equal parts."

**Student Action:** Click to shade one section

**Visual:**
- Rectangle divided into 4 equal vertical sections


---

**On Success:**
- "You divided it into equal parts. Good work."
- "Right there - each part is the same size."

# Problem 2: Identify

**Goal:** Students can identify unit fractions
**Difficulty:** 2

---

**Guide:** "Check this out. This circle is split into equal pieces."

**Visual:**
- Circle divided into 6 equal wedges with one wedge shaded blue


**Guide:** "Count how many equal pieces there are total."

**Student Action:** Type the number of total pieces

**Visual:**
- Circle divided into 6 equal wedges with one wedge shaded blue


**Guide:** "The shaded part is 1 piece out of 6 total pieces. Which fraction shows that?"

**Student Action:** Select the correct fraction

**Visual:**

- Button showing 1/6
- Button showing 1/5
- Button showing 6/1
- Button showing 1/2


---

**On Success:**
- "Six pieces total - you counted carefully."
- "Right there - you got how fractions work. The bottom number shows total pieces."

# Problem 3: Apply

**Goal:** Students can partition shapes into equal parts and identify unit fractions
**Difficulty:** 3

---

**Guide:** "Maria says each piece is 1/3 of the whole sandwich. Let's figure out what that means."

**Visual:**
- Large display showing 1/3


**Guide:** "The bottom number shows how many equal pieces total. How many pieces did Maria cut?"

**Student Action:** Type the number of pieces

**Visual:**
- Display showing 1/3 with bottom number highlighted


**Guide:** "Good. Now look at these sandwiches. Find the one cut into 3 equal pieces."

**Student Action:** Drag the correct sandwich to the box

**Visual:**
- Sandwich divided into 2 equal horizontal pieces
- Sandwich divided into 3 equal horizontal pieces
- Sandwich divided into 4 equal horizontal pieces
- Sandwich divided into 3 unequal pieces
- Empty box labeled 'Maria's sandwich'


---

**On Success:**
- "You read the bottom number - that's solid math thinking."
- "You found it. Three equal pieces, just like the fraction shows."
