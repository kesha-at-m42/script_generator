## WARMUP 

**Detail Level:** Structure \+ parameters (AI writes dialogue)

### **Purpose**

Activate recognition of equal vs. unequal parts. Create curiosity about naming equal parts.

### **Parameters**

| Element | Specification |
| :---- | :---- |
| Interactions | 3 (2 identification tasks \+ bridge) |
| Format | Binary/ternary choice from pre-partitioned rectangles |
| Student action | Click to select only—no Toy manipulation |
| Remediation | Light only |
| Tone | Curious, inviting |
| Engagement Anchor | Real-world connection (hook) \+ Choice/Agency (selection tasks) |

### **Constraints**

| USE | AVOID |
| :---- | :---- |
| "equal," "pieces," "same size," "match" | "partition," "whole," "fraction," "halves," "thirds," "fourths," etc. |
| Pre-partitioned rectangles | Student drawing, shading, or Toy manipulation |
| Light remediation | Medium/Heavy remediation |
| Maximum 2 visual states per interaction | Busy screens with multiple elements |

**Interaction W.1: Hook \+ First Identification**

* **Purpose:** Activate equal vs. unequal distinction with simplest case (2 parts).  
* **Hook:** Real-world connection—reference familiar experience of splitting something into same-sized pieces (chocolate bar, sandwich, pizza).  
* **Visual:** Two pre-partitioned rectangles side by side  
  * Rectangle A: 2 equal parts  
  * Rectangle B: 2 unequal parts (one piece visibly larger)  
* **Task:** Student selects the rectangle with equal parts.  
* **Remediation (Light):** Direct attention to size comparison.

**Interaction W.2: Second Identification**

* **Purpose:** Confirm pattern recognition with added complexity. Tests attention to BOTH count and equality.  
* **Visual:** Three pre-partitioned rectangles  
  * Rectangle A: 4 equal parts (correct)  
  * Rectangle B: 4 unequal parts (equality distractor)  
  * Rectangle C: 3 equal parts (count distractor)  
* **Task:** Student selects the rectangle with four equal pieces.  
* **Remediation (Light):** Redirect to counting first, then checking equality.

**Interaction W.3: Bridge to Lesson**

* **Purpose:** Create anticipation for Lesson without teaching.  
* **Visual:** Keep correct rectangle from W.2 visible.  
* **Content:**  
  * Reference what student just did (finding equal pieces)  
  * Tease that equal pieces have special names and a way to write them  
* **No student action.**

### **Verification Checklist**

- [ ] Real-world hook in first 15-20 seconds  
- [ ] Both tasks require judgment (not just clicking)  
- [ ] W.1 includes unequal parts distractor  
- [ ] W.2 includes both equality AND count distractors  
- [ ] Bridge teases naming/notation without teaching  
- [ ] No vocabulary from AVOID column appears  
- [ ] No Toy manipulation by student  
- [ ] Total time under 3 minutes
