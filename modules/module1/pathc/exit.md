## EXIT CHECK

**Detail Level:** Full interaction specification (AI formats and tags)

### **Purpose**

Verify Lesson understanding before Practice. Tests whether student can identify and create fractions using the visual models, notation, and shapes taught in Lesson.

### **Parameters**

| Element | Specification |
| :---- | :---- |
| Problems | 3 |
| Cognitive Types | IDENTIFY and CREATE only (per Modules 1-3 guidance) |
| Time | 3-4 minutes total |
| Tone | Calm, low-stakes |
| Remediation | Full L-M-H added via Remediation Pipeline |

### **Constraints**

| MUST | MUST NOT |
| :---- | :---- |
| Use same visual models as Lesson (grid arrays, hexagons) | Introduce new visual models |
| Use only fractions taught (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6, 1/8) | Use fractions not covered |
| Use same interactions (partition, shade, select) | Add new interaction types |
| Match Lesson difficulty | Increase complexity beyond Lesson |

### **Alignment Check**

| Problem | Tests | Lesson Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| EC.1 | Notation-to-visual matching | Section 2: Notation Bridge |
| EC.2 | Partition \+ shade on grid | Section 1: Grid Mastery |
| EC.3 | Fraction identification on hexagon | Section 3: Hexagon Extension |

### **Transition into Exit Check** 

* **Guide:** "You've been partitioning shapes and naming fractions. Let's see what you know."

**Problem EC.1: Notation Recognition (IDENTIFY)**

* **Visual:** Three grid arrays, each partitioned and shaded: Array A shows 1/3 (3 equal parts, 1 shaded), Array B shows 1/4 (4 equal parts, 1 shaded), Array C shows 1/6 (6 equal parts, 1 shaded). Fraction symbol "1/4" displayed prominently.  
* **Guide:** "Which rectangle shows one-fourth?"  
* **Prompt:** "Select the rectangle that shows 1/4."  
* **Correct Answer:** Array B

**Problem EC.2: Partition and Shade (CREATE)**

* **Visual:** Fresh undivided grid array (same fixed rectangle size as Lesson)  
* **Guide:** "Now you make one. Partition this rectangle into three equal parts, then shade one part to show one-third."  
* **Prompt:** "Partition into 3 equal parts, then shade 1 part."  
* **Correct Answer:** 3 equal sections created (any valid orientation), 1 section shaded  
* **Orientation Note:** Accept vertical OR horizontal cuts per Lesson 1.4 flexibility principle.

**Problem EC.3: Hexagon Recognition (IDENTIFY)**

* **Visual:** Three hexagons, each partitioned and shaded: Hexagon A shows 1/2 (2 equal parts, 1 shaded), Hexagon B shows 1/3 (3 equal parts, 1 shaded), Hexagon C shows 1/6 (6 equal parts, 1 shaded). Fraction symbol "1/3" displayed prominently.  
* **Guide:** "Now with hexagons. Which hexagon shows one-third?"  
* **Prompt:** "Select the hexagon that shows 1/3."  
* **Correct Answer:** Hexagon B

**Exit Check Closure**
