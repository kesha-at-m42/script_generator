The first line has 3 equal intervals - that's thirds, not fourths. The second line has 4 equal intervals from 0 to 1 - see how all four parts are the same size? That's fourths. The third line has 4 intervals, but they're not all equal - the parts are different sizes. So the answer is the second number line. That's how we identify fourths - we need 4 equal parts."
