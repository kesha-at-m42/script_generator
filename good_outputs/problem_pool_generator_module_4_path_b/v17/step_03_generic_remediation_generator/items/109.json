The first line has 4 equal intervals - each space is the same size from 0 to 1. The second line has 5 equal intervals - that would be fifths, not fourths. The third line has 4 intervals, but they're not equal - the spaces are different sizes. So the first line is the answer because it has exactly 4 equal intervals. That's what fourths means - 4 equal parts."
