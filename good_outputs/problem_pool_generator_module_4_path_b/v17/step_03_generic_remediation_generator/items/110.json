Line 1 has 4 equal intervals - that's fourths, not fifths. Line 2 has tick marks that aren't evenly spaced - those intervals aren't equal, so it can't show fifths. Line 3 has exactly 5 equal intervals from 0 to 1 - each part is the same size. That's the number line that shows fifths. Remember, the number of equal intervals tells us what type of fraction we have."
