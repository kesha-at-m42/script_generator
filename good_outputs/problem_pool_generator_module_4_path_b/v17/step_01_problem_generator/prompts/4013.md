## MASTERY TIERS

Difficulty increases through: **parameter complexity**, **visual complexity**, **scaffolding**, and **cognitive demand**.

### Support
**Simplified parameters with additional scaffolding**

- **Purpose:** Build confidence after struggle; provide accessible entry point
- **Target:** 15-20% of problem pool
- **Key Principle:** Simpler versions of the same skill, NOT different concepts
- **Parameter Complexity:** Easiest variables (halves, unit fractions, smaller denominators like 2-3)
- **Visual Design:** Single, straightforward visual with obvious, high-contrast features
- **Scaffolding:** Additional guides, hints visible, or reference visuals shown
- **Cognitive Demand:** Simple recognition or one-step action with heavy guidance
- **Mastery Status:** Does NOT count toward mastery (support only)

### Confidence
**Very simple problems with maximum scaffolding**

- **Purpose:** Build confidence before retry; early practice with clear scaffolding
- **Target:** 10-15% of problem pool
- **Key Principle:** The simplest possible version of the skill being taught
- **Parameter Complexity:** Common, familiar variables (thirds, fourths, simple unit fractions)
- **Visual Design:** Single visual with clear, obvious features
- **Scaffolding:** Maximum scaffolding (labeled tick marks, highlighted features, reference examples)
- **Cognitive Demand:** Direct application of one concept with step-by-step guidance
- **Mastery Status:** Does NOT count toward mastery (confidence building only)

### Baseline
**Core grade-level problems; mastery expectations begin here**

- **Purpose:** Standard mastery assessment at grade-level expectations
- **Target:** 40-50% of problem pool (largest portion)
- **Key Principle:** Problems vary in difficulty but stay within grade-level expectations
- **Parameter Complexity:** Mix of common and less common variables (halves through sixths, mix of unit and non-unit fractions)
- **Visual Design:** May include 2-3 visuals or moderate contrast between options
- **Scaffolding:** Standard presentation without extra support
- **Cognitive Demand:** Clear task requiring understanding, not just pattern-matching
- **Mastery Status:** COUNTS TOWARD MASTERY

### Stretch
**More challenging parameters with less scaffolding**

- **Purpose:** Challenge students who show baseline mastery; deeper exploration
- **Target:** 20-25% of problem pool (second largest portion)
- **Key Principle:** Extends thinking without introducing new concepts
- **Parameter Complexity:** Less familiar variables (sixths, eighths) or multiple fractions to consider
- **Visual Design:** Multiple visuals (3-4) with reduced contrast, requiring careful comparison
- **Scaffolding:** Less scaffolding; fewer labeled elements
- **Cognitive Demand:** Multi-step reasoning, comparing multiple representations, or inverse operations
- **Mastery Status:** COUNTS TOWARD MASTERY

### Challenge
**Most difficult parameters with no scaffolding**

- **Purpose:** Enrichment for advanced students
- **Target:** 5-10% of problem pool
- **Key Principle:** Extends thinking to maximum complexity without leaving the core concept
- **Parameter Complexity:** Most complex variables (eighths, larger numerators, mixed denominators) or abstract scenarios
- **Visual Design:** Many visuals (4+) with subtle differences, or abstract/decontextualized representations
- **Scaffolding:** No scaffolding; may include distractors
- **Cognitive Demand:** Complex reasoning, ordering, transferring across contexts, or sophisticated pattern recognition
- **Mastery Status:** COUNTS TOWARD MASTERY

---
  ## Shape: Number Line

  A 1D visual representation showing equal intervals with tick marks and fraction positions.

  ### Properties
  - **State**: Can be whole (showing only endpoints) or divided with tick marks
  - **Range**: The numerical bounds [start, end], typically [0, 1] but can extend to show fractions greater than 1

  ### Ticks
  Marks at specific positions on the number line.

  #### ticks
  Vertical marks indicating specific positions.
  - **Type**: Fraction OR array of fractions
  - **Description**: Marks at fraction positions on the number line
  - **Always includes**: Ticks at start and end points (e.g., 0 and 1)

  #### points
  Additional visual emphasis by placing dots or points on specific ticks.

  - **Type**: Array of fractions (must correspond to tick positions)
  - **Description**: Highlights specific ticks with dots

  #### labels
  Text annotations on specific ticks.

  - **Type**: Array of fractions (must correspond to tick positions)
  - **Description**: Display fraction values as text at tick positions
  - **Boolean**: Enable/disable labels for all ticks
 
  ### Example Configurations

  **Basic number line with thirds:**
  ```
  range: [0, 1]
  ticks: [0, 1/3, 2/3, 1]
  // Creates: Number line from 0 to 1 with tick marks at thirds
  ```

  **Number line with partly labeled and emphasized points:**
  ```
  range: [0, 1]
  ticks: [0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1]
  points: [1/4, 3/4]
  labels: [1/4, 3/4]
  // Creates: Number line with fourths, highlighting and labeling 1/4 and 3/4
  ```

  ### Constraints
  - Number lines are always labeled with start and end values (typically 0 and 1)
  - Denominators are commonly limited to: 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8
  - Maximum of 3 number lines can be shown for comparison
  - Points and labels can only be attached to existing ticks

  ### Allowed Student Actions
  - **Select**: Select number lines (1 or more) that match the question requirements. For example, select the number line showing fifths.
  - **Place point**: Place points at specific tick marks (1 or more). For example, place a point at 3/5 or place 3/5 on the line.
  - **Label**: Label tick marks by dragging fraction labels (1 or more) to them. For example, place the label on the number line or place 3/5 on the line.

### Block 4: Instructions
Purpose: Step-by-step task instructions
Cacheable: Yes

# TASK INSTRUCTIONS


## TASK

You will receive a problem template that defines a specific type of mathematical interaction.
Your task is to generate concrete problem instances that create meaningful variation across:
1. **Parameter values** (fractions tested)
2. **Mastery tiers** (difficulty levels 0-4)

## INPUT STRUCTURE

The problem template contains:
- **template_id**: Unique identifier for this template type
- **problem_type**: Descriptive statement of the problem type addressed in the template
- **workspace_description**: What the student sees on screen
- **prompt_examples**: Sample variations of how to ask the question
- **action_description**: What the student does to solve (maps to allowed actions from visuals.md)
  - Some templates may list multiple possible interactions (e.g., "Point at tick marks OR Label tick marks by dragging")
  - Use these different interactions to create meaningful variation across questions
- **parameter_coverage**: The mathematical parameters to vary (fractions, denominators, etc.)

## GENERATION STRATEGY

### Parameter Repetition Rules

**MCQ/Select Questions:** Create multiple questions with varied option sets. Same parameter can appear multiple times if option sets differ meaningfully.

**Single Fraction Work (Point/Label/Create one at a time):**
- **CRITICAL: One question per parameter value PER TIER**
- Cannot repeat same parameter at same tier (e.g., two 1/3 questions both at BASELINE ✗)
- Can repeat parameter across different tiers if pedagogically appropriate (e.g., 1/3 at SUPPORT AND 1/3 at BASELINE ✓)
- If template has only one tier (e.g., ["BASELINE"]), each parameter appears ONCE total
- Example: ["SUPPORT", "BASELINE"] with ["1/2", "1/3", "1/4"]
  - Valid: SUPPORT has 1/2, 1/3; BASELINE has 1/3, 1/4, 1/5
  - Invalid: SUPPORT has 1/3 twice, or BASELINE has 1/4 three times

### Axes of Variation

**1. Parameters:** Use values from parameter_coverage. Track in variables_used (use "fractions" as key when possible).

**2. Mastery Tiers:** ONLY use tiers from template's mastery_tier field. Distribute problems across allowed tiers.

**3. Visuals:** Vary workspace configurations, labeling schemes, tick mark densities.
   - **CRITICAL: All visual elements in a workspace MUST be visually distinct**
   - If workspace has multiple number lines/shapes, each MUST have different visual characteristics
   - For comparison tasks: Each number line must have a point at a DIFFERENT fraction position
   - INVALID: Three lines all with points at 2/6 (visually identical)
   - VALID: First line point at 2/6, second line point at 5/6, third line point at 1/6 (all distinct)

**4. Actions:** When template lists multiple interactions (e.g., "Point OR Label"), alternate between them.

### Mapping to Allowed Actions

Reference **visuals.md** for allowed student actions. Map template actions to closest approved action that sustains the pedagogical goal.

**MCQs:** Allowed student action (not in visuals.md). Students select from array of options. Specify options in workspace_description.

### Option Design Best Practices

**Applies to MCQ and select questions:**
- Recommended: 3-4 options (avoid binary/2-option choices when possible)
- Always ensure only ONE correct answer
- Consider including one distractor (similar to correct answer)
- Consider including one obviously incorrect option
- Avoid equivalent fractions as separate options (e.g., don't have both "2/4" and "1/2", or "5/3" and "1 2/3")
- Example patterns:
  - Correct: "2/3" | Distractor: "3/2" or "2/5" | Wrong: "5/3"
  - Correct: "1/4" | Distractor: "1/3" | Wrong: "3/4"
- Misconception-based distractors (most effective):
  - Visual: Number line from 1 to 2, divided in thirds (6 total intervals)
  - Correct: "5/3" | Good distractor: "5/6" (targets misconception of counting all intervals instead of parts per unit) | Wrong: "2/3"

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

**1. problem_instance_id:** Sequential (1, 2, 3...)

**2. template_id:** Copy from template

**3. problem_type:** Copy verbatim from template

**4. workspace_description:** Visual setup that ONLY uses features defined in visuals.md
   - Refer to <visuals> documentation for allowed workspace elements
   - Do NOT invent or describe visual features not listed in visuals.md
   - Only describe: tick marks, points, labels, range - nothing else

**5. action_description:** Map template's action to closest allowed action from visuals.md (or MCQ)
   - Choose the most pedagogically and interactively similar allowed action
   - If template lists multiple action options, alternate between them for variety

**6. prompt:** Student-facing question
   - **CRITICAL: Use ONLY sentence structures and verbs from prompt_examples**
   - Variation = swap parameter values only
   - VALID: "Place one-fourth" when example is "Place one-third"
   - INVALID: "Put one-fourth" or "Show one-fourth" when example is "Place"
   - Rotate through all prompt_examples structures

**7. mastery_tier:** ONLY use values from template's mastery_tier field in UPPERCASE (e.g., if template has ["BASELINE"], all problems use "BASELINE")

**8. variables_used:** Parameter values (use "fractions" as key when possible)

**9. application_context:** (ONLY for "apply" mastery_verb)
   - Create variety by varying subjects while keeping sentence structure the same
   - Names: Vary between Sam, Alex, Maya, Jordan, Hannah, etc.
   - Objects: If one says "chocolate bars", alternate to "cinnamon sticks", "vanilla wafers", "sugar cookies", etc.
   - Actions/Subjects: If one says "frog jumped", alternate to "cricket hopped", "grasshopper leaped", "rabbit jumped", etc.
   - Keep the sentence structure consistent but vary the nouns and subjects
   - Example variations:
     - "Sam walked 5 spaces..." → "Alex walked 5 spaces...", "Jordan walked 5 spaces..."
     - "Recipe asks for chocolate bars" → "Recipe asks for cinnamon sticks", "Recipe asks for vanilla wafers"
     - "Frog jumped 6 fourths" → "Cricket hopped 6 fourths", "Grasshopper leaped 6 fourths"

## QUALITY CHECKLIST

**Parameter Coverage:**
- Single fraction work: One question per parameter per tier (can repeat across tiers)
- MCQ: Parameters can repeat if option sets differ meaningfully
- Use ONLY tiers from template's mastery_tier field

**Prompt Adherence:**
- Use ONLY sentence structures and verbs from prompt_examples
- Variation = swap parameter values ONLY
- No invented phrasings or new action verbs

**Visual Variety:**
- Vary workspace descriptions across problems
- MCQ: Each option set has different combinations
- Actions: Alternate when template allows multiple

**STOP Signs:**
- ✗ Using tiers not in template's mastery_tier field
- ✗ Inventing new prompt language/verbs not in prompt_examples
- ✗ Same parameter at same tier multiple times (single fraction work)
- ✗ Creating more questions than needed (if 5 fractions and 1 tier, create 5 questions, not 10)
- ✗ Identical option sets (MCQ)
- ✗ **Visually identical elements in workspace** (e.g., two number lines with points at same position)
- ✗ **Inventing visual features not in visuals.md** (e.g., "dotted lines", "highlighted intervals", "shaded regions")
