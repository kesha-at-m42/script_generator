Look at the number line and notice all the fractions: 3/3, 4/3, 5/3. They all have 3 on the bottom. That's because the number line is divided into thirds - 3 equal parts between 0 and 1. The denominator stays 3 whether we're at 3/3, which equals 1, or at 4/3, which is past 1. So the denominator of 4/3 is 3. The denominator tells us what size pieces we're counting, and that doesn't change as we move along the number line."
