Starting from 0, the first unlabeled tick is 1 third from zero - that's where 1/3 goes. Two thirds from zero is 2/3. Three thirds from zero equals 1, so 3/3 goes right at the 1 mark. Now we continue past 1. Four thirds from zero is 4/3 - that's one tick past the 1. Five thirds from zero is 5/3 - that's two ticks past the 1. So the labels go: 2/3 at the second tick, 3/3 at the third tick where 1 is, 4/3 at the fourth tick past 1, and 5/3 at the fifth tick. That's how we label thirds on a number line that extends past 1 - we keep counting thirds from zero."
