Now for 5/6 - this is five out of six equal parts, which is one sixth less than a whole. Count five ticks from 0, and you'll place 5/6 one tick before the 1 mark. Finally, 7/6 is seven-sixths, which means one sixth more than 1 whole. Count seven ticks from 0, or just go one tick past the 1 mark, and that's where 7/6 goes.
