I count 4 equal intervals from 0 to 1, so the denominator is 4. This means we're working with fourths. Now for the numerator - we count how many of those intervals from 0 to where the point is. Even though the point is past 1, we keep counting from 0. The point is 6 intervals from zero, so the numerator is 6. That makes this fraction 6/4. That's how we identify fractions - denominator first by counting equal intervals from 0 to 1, then numerator by counting intervals from 0 to the point."
