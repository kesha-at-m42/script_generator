I count 4 equal intervals from 0 to 1, so the denominator is 4. This means we're working with fourths. Now for the numerator - we count how many of those intervals from 0 to where the point is. We count past 1 and keep going: 1, 2, 3, 4 gets us to 1, then 5, 6, 7 gets us to the point. The point is 7 intervals from zero, so the numerator is 7. That makes this fraction 7/4. That's how we identify fractions - denominator first by counting equal intervals from 0 to 1, then numerator by counting intervals from 0 to the point, even when we go past 1."
