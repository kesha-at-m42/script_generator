I count 4 equal intervals from 0 to 1, so the denominator is 4. This means we're working with fourths. Now for the numerator - we count how many of those intervals from 0 to where the point is. The point is 5 intervals from zero - that's 4 intervals to get to 1, then 1 more interval past 1. So the numerator is 5. That makes this fraction 5/4. That's how we identify fractions - denominator first by counting equal intervals from 0 to 1, then numerator by counting intervals from 0 to the point."
