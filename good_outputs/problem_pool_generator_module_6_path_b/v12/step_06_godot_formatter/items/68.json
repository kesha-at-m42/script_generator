For three-thirds, we count 3 intervals from zero. That's 3 out of 3 equal parts, which equals 1 whole. So three-thirds goes right at the 1 position. For four-thirds, we count 4 intervals from zero. That's 1 interval past the whole, so four-thirds goes at the first tick past 1. For five-thirds, we count 5 intervals from zero. That's 2 intervals past the whole, so five-thirds goes at the second tick past 1. That's how we label fractions beyond one - count the numerator's number of intervals from zero, even when it takes us past 1."
