I count 6 equal intervals from 0 to 1, so the denominator is 6. This means we're working with sixths. Now for the numerator - we count how many of those intervals from 0 to where the point is. Even though the point is past 1, we keep counting: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 gets us to 1, then one more interval gets us to the point. That's 7 intervals from zero, so the numerator is 7. That makes this fraction 7/6. That's how we identify fractions past 1 - denominator first by counting equal intervals from 0 to 1, then numerator by counting all the intervals from 0 to the point."
