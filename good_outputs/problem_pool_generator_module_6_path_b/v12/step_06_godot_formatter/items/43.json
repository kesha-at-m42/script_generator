Look at the sequence: 2/3 has 3 on the bottom, 3/3 has 3 on the bottom, and 4/3 has 3 on the bottom. The denominator never changes because we're always working with thirds - pieces that are one-third in size. Only the top number, the numerator, changes as we count more thirds. So the denominator stayed the same at 3. That's how denominators work - they stay constant when we're counting with the same size pieces."
