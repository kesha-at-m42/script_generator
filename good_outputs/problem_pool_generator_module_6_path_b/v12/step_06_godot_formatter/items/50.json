I count 3 equal intervals from 0 to 1, so the denominator is 3. This means we're working with thirds. Now for the numerator - we count how many of those intervals from 0 to where the point is. The point is 5 intervals from zero, so the numerator is 5. That makes this fraction 5/3. That's how we identify fractions - denominator first by counting equal intervals from 0 to 1, then numerator by counting intervals from 0 to the point."
