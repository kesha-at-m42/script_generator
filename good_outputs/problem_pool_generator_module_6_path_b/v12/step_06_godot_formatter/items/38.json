Start with 4/3 - that means 4 thirds total. Count 4 intervals from zero: 1/3, 2/3, 3/3 (which equals 1), and then one more to 4/3. That's where 4/3 goes. Next is 5/3 - count 5 intervals from zero, which puts it at the next tick mark after 4/3. Finally, 6/3 - count 6 intervals from zero. That's actually the same as 2 wholes, so it lands right at 2. That's how we place fractions greater than 1 - we keep counting thirds past the whole."
