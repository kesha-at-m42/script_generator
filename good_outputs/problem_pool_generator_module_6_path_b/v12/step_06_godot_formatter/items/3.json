When we continue past 1, that spacing doesn't change. From 1 to 2 is the same distance as from 0 to 1, so we need 6 more equal intervals. That means we place 5 more tick marks between 1 and 2, keeping the same spacing. Those marks represent 7/6, 8/6, 9/6, 10/6, and 11/6. That's how partitions extend past 1 - the equal spacing continues."
