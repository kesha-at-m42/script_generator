In 3/4, the top number 3 is smaller than the bottom number 4, so that's not improper. In 4/3, the top number 4 is bigger than the bottom number 3. That means 4/3 is greater than 1, so 4/3 is the improper fraction. That's how we identify improper fractions—when the top number is bigger than the bottom number."
