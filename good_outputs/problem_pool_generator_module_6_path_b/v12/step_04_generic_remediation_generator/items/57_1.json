For 7/4, the numerator 7 is greater than the denominator 4, so 7/4 is greater than one. For 4/3, the numerator 4 is greater than the denominator 3, so 4/3 is also greater than one. For 5/6, the numerator 5 is less than the denominator 6, so it's less than one. For 3/4, the numerator 3 is less than the denominator 4, so it's also less than one. The answers are 7/4 and 4/3. That's how we identify fractions greater than one - when the numerator is greater than the denominator."
