        "CRITICAL: Multiple correct answers for single-select question. Option (a) 'all of them, which is 1 whole' AND option (d) 'Because we divided something into thirds' are both logically correct answers to 'Why does 3/3 equal 1?'. Option (a) explains the fraction-to-whole relationship (numerator=denominator=complete set), while option (d) explains the division operation. For single-select click_choice, only ONE option should be correct. SOLUTION: Either (1) use multi_click_choice with both as correct answers, or (2) rewrite option (d) to be incorrect (e.g., 'Because we divided something into thirds' → 'Because we divided something into fourths')"

        "CRITICAL: Multiple correct answers exist for MCQ. Option (a) 'all of them, which is 1 whole' AND option (d) 'Because we divided something into fourths' are both logically correct answers, but the workspace shows 1/3 intervals (thirds, not fourths). However, option (a) directly answers 'why 3/3=1' with sound mathematical reasoning. Option (d) is incorrect due to workspace mismatch (thirds vs fourths), but the fundamental issue is that option (a) is the only mathematically sound answer—this is acceptable. REVISED: No error here; option (d) is factually wrong (fourths vs thirds shown).",
        "CRITICAL: Workspace-dialogue mismatch. Dialogue states 'All three parts are shaded' and prompt asks about 3/3, but workspace shows intervals='1/3' with intervals_is_shaded=true. This creates ambiguity: does '1/3' mean each interval is 1/3 (so 3 intervals = 1 whole), or does it mean only 1/3 is shaded? The 'intervals_is_shaded: true' suggests ALL intervals are shaded, which would be correct for 3/3, but the labeling is unclear. Clarify: if all three 1/3 intervals are shaded, explicitly confirm this represents 3/3 shaded."

This makes (d) clearly incorrect, which is fine for a distractor, but the contradiction is stark and may confuse learners about what the workspace represents.",
        "CLARITY: The workspace element 'intervals: 1/3' with 'intervals_is_shaded: true' needs explicit confirmation in dialogue or visual labels showing all 3 parts shaded to match the claim 'All three parts are shaded.'"
