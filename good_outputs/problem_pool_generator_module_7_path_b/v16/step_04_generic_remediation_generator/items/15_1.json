When we have all the parts—every single one of them—they make up one complete whole. That's why 6/6 equals 1. The answer is that 6 parts out of 6 total is all of them, which is 1 whole. This is true for any fraction where the numerator and denominator are the same—you have all the parts, so you have one whole."
