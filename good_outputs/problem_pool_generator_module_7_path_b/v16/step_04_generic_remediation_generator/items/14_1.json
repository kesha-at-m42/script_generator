It doesn't matter that there are 5 parts specifically, or whether 5 is odd or even. What matters is that you have every single part. When you have all the parts of something, you have 1 whole. That's why any fraction where the numerator equals the denominator equals 1 - because having all the parts means having one complete whole."
