When we look at 4/4, the numerator tells us we have 4 parts, and the denominator tells us the whole is made of 4 parts. So 4/4 means we have all 4 parts out of the 4 parts that make the whole. When we have all the parts, nothing is missing, so we have one complete whole. That's why the answer is 'We have all the parts, so it makes a complete whole.' When the numerator and denominator are the same, we always have one whole because we have all the parts."
