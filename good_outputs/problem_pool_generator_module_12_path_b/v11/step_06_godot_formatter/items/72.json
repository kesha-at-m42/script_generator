In 3/4 and 3/8, the numerators are both 3 - that's what's the same. The denominators are different - 4 and 8. When the numerators are the same, we're counting the same number of parts in each fraction. So the strategy is to compare the part sizes. Look at the bars - fourths are bigger than eighths. That's why the correct strategy is to check for the same numerator, then compare part sizes. That's how we choose comparison strategies - we look for what's the same first."
