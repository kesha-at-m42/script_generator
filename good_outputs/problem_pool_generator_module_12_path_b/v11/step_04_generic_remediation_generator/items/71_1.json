When fractions have the same denominator, it means the parts are the same size in both bars. See how both bars are divided into sevenths? Since the parts are equal size, we just count how many parts are shaded - 3 parts versus 5 parts. The answer is 'Check for the same denominator, count the parts.' That's how we choose a comparison strategy - find what matches, then apply that strategy."
