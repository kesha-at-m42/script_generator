That means the parts are all the same size. Look at the bars - each ninth is exactly the same size in both bars. When denominators match like this, we just count the shaded parts. 2 ninths versus 7 ninths. Since the parts are equal, more parts means a larger fraction. The strategy is: check for the same denominator, then count the parts. That's how we compare fractions with the same denominator."
