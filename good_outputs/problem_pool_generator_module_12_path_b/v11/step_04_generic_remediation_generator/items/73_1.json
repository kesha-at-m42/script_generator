First, check the numerators: 4 and 2 - these are different. Next, check the denominators: 6 and 5 - these are also different. Since neither the numerators nor denominators match, we can't use the same numerator strategy or same denominator strategy. That means we need to use the benchmark strategy. That's how we choose the right comparison approach - check what's the same first, then pick the matching strategy."
