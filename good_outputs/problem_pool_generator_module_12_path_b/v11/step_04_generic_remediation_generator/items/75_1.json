Next, we check the denominators: 5/8 has denominator 8, and 1/3 has denominator 3. These are also different. Since neither the numerators nor the denominators match, we can't use the same numerator strategy or the same denominator strategy. That means we need to use the benchmark strategy. That's how we choose - when neither numerators nor denominators are the same, we use the benchmark."
