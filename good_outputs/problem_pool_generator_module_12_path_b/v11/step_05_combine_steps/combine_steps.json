Fewer divisions means bigger pieces. So one-fifth is bigger than one-eighth. That means 3 fifths is more than 3 eighths. Looking at the bars, you can see 3/5 takes up more space than 3/8.

Since seven-tenths is above one-half and three-eighths is below one-half, we know seven-tenths must be greater. So the answer is seven-tenths is greater than three-eighths.
