Now here's the key part: those same equal intervals continue from 1 to 2. So we place tick marks at [fraction numerator=6 denominator=5]six fifths[/fraction], [fraction numerator=7 denominator=5]seven fifths[/fraction], [fraction numerator=8 denominator=5]eight fifths[/fraction], and [fraction numerator=9 denominator=5]nine fifths[/fraction], keeping exactly the same spacing we used from 0 to 1.

From 0 to 1, we place tick marks at [fraction numerator=1 denominator=4]one fourth[/fraction], [fraction numerator=2 denominator=4]two fourths[/fraction], and [fraction numerator=3 denominator=4]three fourths[/fraction] - dividing that section into 4 equal parts. Then from 1 to 2, we continue with [fraction numerator=5 denominator=4]five fourths[/fraction], [fraction numerator=6 denominator=4]six fourths[/fraction], and [fraction numerator=7 denominator=4]seven fourths[/fraction] - dividing that section into 4 equal parts too. That gives us [vocab]fourths[/vocab] all the way from 0 to 2. That's how we partition a number line into equal fractional parts."
