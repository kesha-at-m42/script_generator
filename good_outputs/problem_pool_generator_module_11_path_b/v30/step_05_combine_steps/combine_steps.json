Each sixth is a smaller interval - notice how it takes 6 of them to make the whole compared to just 3 thirds. Since we're counting 2 of the larger intervals on top versus 2 of the smaller intervals on bottom, 2/3 takes us farther from zero than 2/6. So 2/3 is greater than 2/6. The answer is >.

Both fractions have the same numerator - 3 - which means both take three steps from zero.

But here's the key: we need to look at the size of each step. On the top number line, one-seventh is a small interval because we need 7 equal parts to make the whole. On the bottom number line, one-fourth is a bigger interval because we only need 4 equal parts to make the whole. Since fourths are bigger intervals than sevenths, three fourths reaches farther than three sevenths. So 3/7 is less than 3/4. The answer is less than. That's how we compare fractions with the same numerator - the fraction with the smaller denominator has bigger intervals and is the larger fraction."

The question is: which intervals are bigger? Look at the top number line. It's divided into tenths, which means 10 equal parts from 0 to 1. Those are pretty small intervals. Now look at the bottom number line. It's divided into sixths—only 6 equal parts from 0 to 1. Since there are fewer parts dividing the same distance, each sixth is bigger than each tenth. So 3 sixths is more than 3 tenths. That means 3/10 is less than 3/6, so the answer is <. When numerators are the same, the fraction with the bigger unit intervals is the bigger fraction."

The bottom number line is divided into 10 equal parts from 0 to 1, so each tenth is smaller. When the denominator is smaller, each part is bigger. So one-seventh is bigger than one-tenth. That means 4 sevenths takes us farther along the number line than 4 tenths. The point at 4/7 is farther from 0 than the point at 4/10. Therefore, 4/7 is greater than 4/10.

So the question becomes: which parts are bigger, fifths or ninths? Look at the bars carefully. The first bar is divided into 5 equal parts, and the second bar is divided into 9 equal parts. When you divide the same whole into fewer parts, each part is bigger. So fifths are bigger pieces than ninths. Since we have 4 of each, 4 fifths must be greater than 4 ninths. The answer is that both show 4 parts, but fifths are bigger than ninths. That's how we compare fractions with the same numerator - the one with the smaller denominator has bigger parts."

When numerators are the same, here's the key rule: the fraction with the smaller denominator is actually larger. Why? Because fourths are bigger pieces than sevenths. If you divide something into 4 parts, each part is bigger than if you divided it into 7 parts. Look at the bars - you can see that 3 fourths takes up more space than 3 sevenths. So 3/4 is greater than 3/7. The answer is the greater than symbol. That's how same numerator comparisons work - fewer parts means bigger pieces."

And 1/2 means dividing into just 2 parts - those are the biggest pieces. So from smallest to largest, it's 1/6, then 1/3, then 1/2. That's the key with unit fractions - bigger denominator means smaller piece."

One-third means we divide something into 3 equal parts - those are fairly large pieces. One-fifth means 5 equal parts - smaller pieces. One-seventh means 7 equal parts - even smaller pieces. So the pattern is: the smaller the denominator, the bigger the piece. That means 1/3 is the largest, then 1/5, then 1/7. The correct order from largest to smallest is 1/3, 1/5, 1/7. That's how unit fractions work - smaller denominators make bigger pieces."
