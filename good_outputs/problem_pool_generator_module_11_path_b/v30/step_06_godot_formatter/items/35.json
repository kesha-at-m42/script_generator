Bar A is divided into 5 equal parts, and bar B is divided into 9 equal parts. When you divide the same whole into more pieces, each piece gets smaller. That means ninths are smaller than fifths. So even though we have 4 pieces shaded in both, four fifths covers more space than four ninths. The answer is 4/5 > 4/9. When numerators are the same, the fraction with the smaller denominator is greater because its pieces are bigger."
