The first bar is divided into 5 equal parts, and the second bar is divided into 7 equal parts. When we divide the same whole into more pieces, each piece becomes smaller. So sevenths are smaller than fifths. Since we have the same number of pieces (3) but fifths are bigger pieces, 3/5 is greater than 3/7. The answer is 3/5 > 3/7. That's how we compare fractions with the same numerator - the one with the smaller denominator is greater because its pieces are bigger."
