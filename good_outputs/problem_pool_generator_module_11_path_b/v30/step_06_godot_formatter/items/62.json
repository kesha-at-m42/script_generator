That's our first key strategy: checking for the same numerator. When numerators are the same, we compare the sizes of the parts. Look at the fraction strips - each fourth is much bigger than each ninth. So 3 fourths is more than 3 ninths. The two strategies that help us here are: check for same numerator, and compare the sizes of parts. When fractions have the same numerator, the one with bigger pieces is the greater fraction."
