But when fractions have the same numerator, the one with the smaller denominator is greater. Here's why: thirds are bigger pieces than fifths. Think about it - if you cut something into 3 pieces, each piece is bigger than if you cut it into 5 pieces. So 2/3 means 2 big pieces, while 2/5 means 2 smaller pieces. The answer is 2/3 > 2/5. That's how we compare fractions with the same numerator - fewer pieces means bigger pieces."
