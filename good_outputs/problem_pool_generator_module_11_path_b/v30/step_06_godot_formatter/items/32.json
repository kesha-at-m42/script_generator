The first bar is divided into fourths - that means 4 equal parts make the whole. The second bar is divided into sixths - 6 equal parts make the whole. When you divide something into more pieces, each piece gets smaller. So one fourth is bigger than one sixth. That means 2 fourths is bigger than 2 sixths. The answer is 2/4 > 2/6. When fractions have the same numerator, the one with the smaller denominator is larger because its pieces are bigger."
