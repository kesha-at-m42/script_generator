The first bar is divided into fourths - each piece is pretty big. The second bar is divided into eighths - each piece is much smaller. When we have the same count of pieces shaded, we compare the size of the pieces. Fourths are bigger than eighths, so 3 fourths covers more space than 3 eighths. That means 3/4 is greater than 3/8. That's how we compare fractions with the same numerator - the one with bigger pieces is greater."
