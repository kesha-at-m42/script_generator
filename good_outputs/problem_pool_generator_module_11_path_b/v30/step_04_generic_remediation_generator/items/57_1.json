That means both bars are divided into tenths, so all the parts are equal size. When fractions have the same denominator, we use two strategies: first, we check for same denominator to know the parts are equal, and second, we count the equal parts to see which fraction has more. The answers are 'Check for same denominator' and 'Count the equal parts.' That's how we compare fractions with the same denominator."
