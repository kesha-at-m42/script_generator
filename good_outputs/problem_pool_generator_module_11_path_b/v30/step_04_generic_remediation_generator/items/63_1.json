Next, when numerators are the same, we compare the sizes of the parts. Look at the bars—sixths are bigger pieces than tenths. Since we have 4 of each, four bigger pieces make a bigger fraction than four smaller pieces. So the two strategies are: check for same numerator, then compare the sizes of parts. That's how we compare fractions with the same numerator."
