We need to check for same numerator. Next, since the numerators match but the fractions look different, we compare the sizes of the parts themselves. Look at the strips - the fourths are bigger pieces than the sixths. So the two things that help us compare are: check for same numerator, and compare the sizes of parts. That's how we compare fractions with the same numerator."
