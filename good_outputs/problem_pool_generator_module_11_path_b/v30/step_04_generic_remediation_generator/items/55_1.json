Both fractions have 9 in the denominator, so yes, they have the same denominator. When fractions have the same denominator, it means the parts are the same size, so we don't need to compare the sizes of parts. Instead, we count the equal parts - that's the second step. We count how many ninths are shaded in each bar. Bar A has 2 ninths, Bar B has 7 ninths. The two steps are: check for same denominator, and count the equal parts. That's the strategy when denominators match."
