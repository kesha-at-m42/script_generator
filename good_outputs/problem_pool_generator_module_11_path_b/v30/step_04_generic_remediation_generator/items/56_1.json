When fractions have the same denominator, the parts are the same size, so we can count how many parts are shaded. Bar A has 4 eighths shaded and Bar B has 1 eighth shaded. The two strategies that work here are: check for same denominator, and count the equal parts. These strategies work together - same denominator tells us the parts are equal, so we can compare by counting. That's how we compare fractions with the same denominator."
