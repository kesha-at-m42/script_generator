When fractions have the same numerator, we compare them by looking at the size of the pieces. Look at the bars - fifths are bigger pieces than sevenths because 5 parts is fewer parts than 7 parts. So to compare these fractions, we check for same numerator and compare the sizes of parts. That's how we compare fractions with the same numerator - fewer parts means bigger pieces."
