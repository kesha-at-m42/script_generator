That's step one. When denominators are the same, the parts are already equal size, so we don't need to compare part sizes. Instead, we move to counting the equal parts - 1/7 has 1 part shaded and 6/7 has 6 parts shaded. So the two steps we use here are: check for same denominator, then count the equal parts. That's how the strategy works when denominators match."
