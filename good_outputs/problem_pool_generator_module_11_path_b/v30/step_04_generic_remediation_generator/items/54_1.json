That means the parts are the same size. When denominators are the same, we count the equal parts - bar A has 3 sixths shaded and bar B has 5 sixths shaded. Since 5 is more than 3, we know 5/6 is greater than 3/6. So the two strategies are: check for same denominator, then count the equal parts. That's how we compare fractions with the same denominator."
