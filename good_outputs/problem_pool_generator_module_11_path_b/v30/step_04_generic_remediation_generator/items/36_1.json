Look at the bar showing 2/6 - each sixth is a bigger piece. Now look at the bar showing 2/9 - each ninth is a smaller piece. When we have the same count of pieces, the one with bigger pieces is greater. So 2/6 is greater than 2/9. That's how we compare fractions with the same numerator - bigger pieces win."
