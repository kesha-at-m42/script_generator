The second bar is divided into 8 equal parts - these are eighths. When you cut the same whole into more pieces, each piece gets smaller. So sixths are bigger than eighths. Since we have 3 of the bigger pieces versus 3 of the smaller pieces, 3/6 is greater than 3/8. When the numerators are the same, the fraction with the smaller denominator is larger."
