When the numerators are the same, that's our first clue. We need to check for same numerator. Next, since the numerators match but the fractions look different, we compare the sizes of the parts themselves. Look at the strips - the fourths are bigger pieces than the sixths. So the two things that help us compare are: check for same numerator, and compare the sizes of parts. That's how we compare fractions with the same numerator."

Each sixth is a smaller interval - notice how it takes 6 of them to make the whole compared to just 3 thirds. Since we're counting 2 of the larger intervals on top versus 2 of the smaller intervals on bottom, 2/3 takes us farther from zero than 2/6. So 2/3 is greater than 2/6. The answer is >.

Both fractions have the same numerator - 3 - which means both take three steps from zero.

Now look at the bottom number line. It's divided into sixths—only 6 equal parts from 0 to 1. Since there are fewer parts dividing the same distance, each sixth is bigger than each tenth. So 3 sixths is more than 3 tenths. That means 3/10 is less than 3/6, so the answer is <. When numerators are the same, the fraction with the bigger unit intervals is the bigger fraction."

If you divide something into 4 parts, each part is bigger than if you divided it into 7 parts. Look at the bars - you can see that 3 fourths takes up more space than 3 sevenths. So 3/4 is greater than 3/7. The answer is the greater than symbol. That's how same numerator comparisons work - fewer parts means bigger pieces."

Sixths means the whole is divided into 6 parts, and tenths means it's divided into 10 parts. When you divide something into fewer parts, each part is bigger. So each sixth is bigger than each tenth. Since we have 3 pieces in both fractions, and sixths are bigger pieces than tenths, 3/6 is greater than 3/10. The answer is 3/6 > 3/10.
