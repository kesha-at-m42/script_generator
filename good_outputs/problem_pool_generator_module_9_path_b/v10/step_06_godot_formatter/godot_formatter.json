Multiplying both 1 and 3 by 2 gives us 2/6, so these match. Pair 3: 1/2 and 1/3 are different amounts - there's no way to multiply to get from one to the other. Pair 4: 3/4 and 6/8. Multiplying both 3 and 4 by 2 gives us 6/8, so these are equivalent. Pair 5: 2/4 and 3/6. If we simplify 2/4 we get 1/2, and 3/6 simplifies to 1/2 as well - wait, let me recalculate. 2/4 equals 1/2, and 3/6 equals 1/2, so actually these are equivalent too. So pairs 1, 2, and 4 are the equivalent pairs. That's how we identify equivalent fractions - both the numerator and denominator must be multiplied by the same factor."
