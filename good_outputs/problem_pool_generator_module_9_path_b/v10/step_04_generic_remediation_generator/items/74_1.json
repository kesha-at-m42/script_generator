Let's check each one. 1/2 and 4/8: Half of something is the same as 4 out of 8 equal parts - both show the same amount, so these are equivalent. 1/4 and 2/8: One-fourth is the same as 2 out of 8 equal parts - they're equivalent too. And 2/4 and 3/6: 2/4 is half, and 3/6 is also half - so these are equivalent as well. The answers are pairs a, c, and f. That's how we identify equivalent fractions - we look for pairs that represent the same amount even when they have different denominators."
