Now for the bottom bar - it's divided into 4 equal parts. To show the same amount as the top bar, we need to shade half of this bar too. Half of 4 parts is 2 parts. So we shade 2 out of the 4 parts to make 2/4. Both 3/6 and 2/4 equal one-half. That's how equivalent fractions work - they show the same amount even with different denominators."
