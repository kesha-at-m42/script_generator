Now look at the bottom line with eighths. The bottom line has 8 equal parts, and we need to count to the fourth one. Starting from 0, we count: one eighth, two eighths, three eighths, four eighths. Four eighths lands exactly at the halfway point - the same spot as one half on the top line. That's because four eighths equals one half.
