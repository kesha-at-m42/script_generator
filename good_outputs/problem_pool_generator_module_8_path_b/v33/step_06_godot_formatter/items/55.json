Notice that each third from the top bar lines up with exactly 2 sixths below it. Since 2 thirds are shaded above, we need to shade 2 groups of 2 sixths, which equals 4 sixths total. When you shade 4 out of the 6 parts, you'll see they take up the same amount of space as the 2/3 above. That's how equivalent fractions work - different numbers of parts showing the same amount."
