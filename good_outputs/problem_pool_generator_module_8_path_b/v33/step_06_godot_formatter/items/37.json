It's divided into sixths, so we need to count the equal intervals from 0 to 1. There are 6 equal parts. To find three sixths, we count 3 of those parts from 0. When we do that, three sixths lands at exactly the same position as one half on the top line. That's why three sixths equals one half - they're at the same location. That's how equivalent fractions work."
