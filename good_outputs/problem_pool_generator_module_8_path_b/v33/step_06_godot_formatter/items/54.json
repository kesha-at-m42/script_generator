To find the same amount, we need to see how many sixths fit into one third. If we look at where the one third ends on the top bar, we can see it lines up with the second sixth mark on the bottom bar. So we need to shade 2 sixths to equal 1 third. That's how equivalent fractions work - different parts, same amount."
