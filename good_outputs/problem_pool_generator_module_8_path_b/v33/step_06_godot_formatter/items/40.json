Four sixths lands at the fourth tick mark out of six. Notice that's at the exact same position as two thirds on the top line. That's because two thirds and four sixths are equivalent - they represent the same amount. Place your point at the fourth tick mark on the bottom line, right where it lines up with two thirds above. That's how equivalent fractions work on number lines - they land at the same position."
