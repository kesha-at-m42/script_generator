  ## Shape: Number Line

  A 1D visual representation showing equal intervals with tick marks and fraction positions.

  ### Properties
  - **State**: Can be whole (showing only endpoints) or divided with tick marks
  - **Range**: The numerical bounds [start, end], typically [0, 1] but can extend to show fractions greater than 1
  - **Role**: Determines if this is a reference visual (non-interactable) or an option/target (interactable)
    - **Reference**: For display only - cannot be selected, clicked, or modified (e.g., reference bar at top for comparison)
    - **Option/Target**: Default - can be selected, clicked, or modified by student (e.g., selectable answer choices)
    - Mark reference tangibles in workspace descriptions as "reference bar" or "for comparison only"

  ### Ticks
  Marks at specific positions on the number line.

  #### ticks
  Vertical marks indicating specific positions.
  - **Type**: Fraction OR array of fractions
  - **Description**: Marks at fraction positions on the number line
  - **Always includes**: Ticks at start and end points (e.g., 0 and 1)
  - **is_read_only**: Boolean indicating whether the tick is interactable (default: `false`). Set to `true` for tick marks that should not accept dragged labels (e.g., endpoints, already labeled ticks)

  #### points
  Additional visual emphasis by placing dots or points on specific ticks.

  - **Type**: Array of fractions (must correspond to tick positions)
  - **Description**: Highlights specific ticks with dots

  #### labels
  Text annotations on specific ticks.

  - **Type**: Array of fractions (must correspond to tick positions)
  - **Description**: Display fraction values as text at tick positions
  - **Boolean**: Enable/disable labels for all ticks

  ### Example Configurations

  **Basic number line with thirds:**
  ```
  range: [0, 1]
  ticks: [0, 1/3, 2/3, 1]
  // Creates: Number line from 0 to 1 with tick marks at thirds
  ```

  **Number line with partly labeled and emphasized points:**
  ```
  range: [0, 1]
  ticks: [0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1]
  points: [1/4, 3/4]
  labels: [1/4, 3/4]
  // Creates: Number line with fourths, highlighting and labeling 1/4 and 3/4
  ```

  ### Constraints
  - Number lines are always labeled with start and end values (typically 0 and 1)
  - Denominators are commonly limited to: 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8
  - Maximum of 3 number lines can be shown for comparison
  - Points and labels can only be attached to existing ticks

  ### Allowed Student Actions
  - **Place tick**: Place ticks on an unpartitioned or partially partitioned number bar. For example, divide this line into thirds or place a tick at 3/5.
  - **Select**: Select number lines (1 or more) that match the question requirements. For example, select the number line showing fifths.
  - **Place point**: Place points at specific tick marks (1 or more). For example, place a point at 3/5 or place 3/5 on the line.
  - **Label**: Label tick marks (1 or more) by dragging fraction labels (1 or more) to them. For example, place/drag the correct label on the given tick mark or place/drag the given fraction on the correct number line.

---
  ## Shape: Fraction Strip

  A 1D rectangular bar representing a whole, shown as a horizontal strip that can be divided into equal sections.

  ### Properties
  - **State**: Can be whole (undivided) or divided into equal sections
  - **Range**: The numerical bounds [start, end], typically [0, 1] but can extend to show fractions greater than 1
  - **Role**: Determines if this is a reference visual (non-interactable) or an option/target (interactable)
    - **Reference**: For display only - cannot be selected, clicked, or modified (e.g., reference bar at top showing target fraction)
    - **Option/Target**: Default - can be selected, clicked, or modified by student (e.g., bars to shade, option bars to select from)
    - Mark reference tangibles in workspace descriptions as "reference bar" or "for comparison only"
  
  ### Intervals
  The distinct sections (parts) created by dividing the strip.

  #### intervals
  Interval sizes defining how the strip is divided.

  - **Type**: Fraction OR array of fractions
  - **Description**: Defines the size of each section in the strip
  - **Uniform spacing**: Use single fraction (e.g., "1/3" creates 3 equal sections)
  - **Non-uniform spacing**: Use array of fractions (e.g., ["1/4", "1/4", "1/2"])

  #### intervals_is_shaded
  Which sections are shaded.

  - **Type**: Boolean OR array of integers (indices)
  - **Description**: Specifies which sections should be shaded
  - **Boolean**: `true` shades all sections, `false` shades none
  - **Array**: Indices of sections to shade (e.g., [0, 2] shades first and third sections)

  #### intervals_is_read_only
  Which sections are non-interactable.

  - **Type**: Boolean OR array of integers (indices)
  - **Description**: Makes specific sections non-interactable
  - **Default**: `false`

  ### Example Configurations

  **Basic fraction strip with thirds:**
  ```
  range: [0, 1]
  intervals: "1/3"
  // Creates: Strip divided into 3 equal sections
  ```

  **Fraction strip with shaded sections:**
  ```
  range: [0, 1]
  intervals: "1/4"
  intervals_is_shaded: [0, 2]
  // Creates: Strip with fourths, first and third sections shaded
  ```

  ### Constraints
  - Denominators are commonly limited to: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 8
  - Maximum of 3 fraction strips can be shown for comparison

  ### Allowed Student Actions
  - **Cut**: Divide the whole strip into intervals. For example, divide this strip into thirds.
  - **Select**: Select fraction strips (1 or more) that match the question requirements. For example, select the strip showing fifths.
  - **Shade**: Select sections to shade or unshade. For example, shade 2/3 of the strip.

**Natural & Economical:**
- Short, clear sentences
- Say things ONCE - don't rephrase or repeat concepts
- Track what's already been said in the sequence; don't re-explain
- Trust students to understand the first time
---

## What You Can Reference

**YES - Observable in current session:**
- Actions the student just took
- What's visible on screen right now
- Patterns in their current work

**NO - Unknowable:**
- What they're thinking or feeling ("You're thinking...")
- Past sessions or student history ("Yesterday you...")
- Assumptions about preferences ("You like...")

---

# Problem Setup Dialogue

**Formula:**
[Narrative scenario from the problem] + [Conversational guidance toward the task]

**Core Purpose:**
Transform the problem into a conversational narrative that guides students toward discovery without giving away the answer. This is practice—be conservative with instruction and information.

**How to Transform question_text and visual_context:**
- Start with the narrative/context from question_text.
- Frame as a conversational question or challenge that guides thinking.
- Don't instruct or explain—guide students to figure it out.
- Avoid repeating mathematical terminology from the prompt.

**Key Approaches:**

1. **Frame as a real-world situation if it has application_context:**
   - "Maya wants to share a chocolate bar with three friends."
   - "Jake has to give half of his energy bar to Sam."

2. **Guide thinking with a question or a task:**
   - "Divide the bar so that everyone gets an equal part."
   - "How many equal parts does this bar have?"
   - "Can you shade the required number of parts?"

3. **Have engaging variety for similar questions:**
  - "Look at these three bars. One of them is partitioned into thirds. Which one is it?"
  - "Here are four bars. Some of them are divided into equal parts. Find the bars with equal parts."
  - "Here's a bar divided into four parts. Are all the parts the same size?"
  - "Look at this bar. Are these parts equal in size?" 
  

**Let students figure it out:**
- Don't instruct ("Remember that fractions...").
- Don't give answers ("Find the bar with 1/4 shaded").
- Don't repeat the prompt verbatim.

**Calibrate to Difficulty:**
- **Lower difficulty (0-1):** More supportive and conversational guidance.
  - Include instruction and helpful hints naturally in the narrative.
  - Mention specific terms if they scaffold without giving away the answer.
- **Higher difficulty (2-4):** Less scaffolding.
  - Frame the challenge, let them work it out.
  - Trust them to apply what they know.

---

## Success Dialogue

**Success Dialogue Formula:**
[Validation (optional)]+ [Observable behavior specific to this problem] + [What it demonstrates about the math concept]

**Core Purpose:**
Reinforce the mathematical concept they just demonstrated. Make success dialogue problem-specific and content-focused.

**Examples:**
- "You found the bar with equal parts." (reinforces: equal parts concept)
- "Good. You shaded one of three equal parts." (reinforces: fraction identification)
- "Good. You shaded one out of three equal parts." (reinforces: numerator/denominator relationship)
- "That's how thirds work, three equal parts." (reinforces: the specific fraction concept)

**Calibrate Praise to Difficulty Level:**

**Level 0-1 (Foundational/Simple):**
Brief, content-focused acknowledgment.
- "You found the bar with equal parts."
- "That's one of two equal parts - one half."
- "Good. You made three equal parts."

**Level 2-3 (Complex):**
Specific acknowledgment that reinforces what they figured out.
- "That's right. You identified that fractions need equal parts."
- "Nice work. You partitioned the bar into eighths."
- "Correct. One-sixth would be one of six equal parts."

**Key Principle:**
Success dialogue should reinforce WHAT THEY JUST SOLVED and the mathematical concept it demonstrates. Be specific about the problem and content, not just the behavior.

### Block 4: Instructions
Purpose: Step-by-step task instructions
Cacheable: Yes

# TASK INSTRUCTIONS


## TASK

Transform problem instances into a structured interaction schema.

## INPUT FORMAT

You receive problem instances with:
- problem_instance_id, template_id, problem_type
- **no_of_steps** (number): 1 for single-step, 2 for multi-step problems
- action_description (student action)
- prompt (student-facing question)
- workspace_description (text description of visuals)
- mastery_tier (support, confidence, baseline, stretch, challenge)
- variables_used (fractions/denominators tested)
- application_context (optional narrative)

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Generate a structured interaction sequence using these fields:

**Required Top-Level Fields:**
- problem_id: Use problem_instance_id
- mastery_tier: Copy from input (support, confidence, baseline, stretch, challenge)
- mastery_verb: Map problem_type to CREATE|IDENTIFY|COMPARE|APPLY
- template_id: Copy from input
- fractions: Extract from variables_used array
- **no_of_steps**: Copy from input (1, 2, 3, or any positive integer)
- **steps**: Array ALWAYS present, containing N step objects (where N = no_of_steps)
  - Single-step: Array with 1 item
  - Multi-step: Array with N items

## HANDLING SINGLE-STEP vs MULTI-STEP

**IMPORTANT: Always output a `steps` array, regardless of no_of_steps value**

**If no_of_steps = 1 (or missing):**
- Generate steps array with ONE item: `"steps": [{ "step_id": 1, ... }]`
- Use input fields directly (workspace_description, prompt, action_description)
- No workspace_inherited flag needed

**If no_of_steps > 1 (multi-step):**
- Generate steps array with N items: `"steps": [{ "step_id": 1, ... }, { "step_id": 2, ... }, ...]`
- **Parse** input fields to extract step-specific information for EACH step
- Input format uses numbered markers: "Step 1:", "Step 2:", etc.
- Add `workspace_inherited: true` to Step 2+

### Multi-Step Parsing Strategy

**1. workspace_description** - Look for "Step N:" markers:
```
"Step 1: Blank line. Step 2: Add labels. Step 3: Verify positions."
→ Extract text between each "Step N:" marker
→ Build workspace for each step
→ Later steps inherit results from earlier steps
```

**2. action_description** - Look for "(step N)" markers:
```
"Student places ticks (step 1), drags labels (step 2), confirms (step 3)."
→ Extract action phrase before each "(step N)"
→ Map to interaction_tool
```

**3. prompt** - Split on "then" or commas:
```
"Divide line, then label positions, then check your work."
→ Step 1: "Divide line into fourths."
→ Step 2: "Label each position."
→ Step 3: "Check that all labels are correct."
```

**4. dialogue** - Generate conversational intros:
```
Step 1: "Let's [task]."
Step 2: "Now [task]."
Step 3+: "Next, [task]."
Final: Use conclusive language
```

**5. Workspace Inheritance** - For Step 2+ only, add `inherited` field to workspace:
```
Step 1 workspace (array format):
"workspace": [
  {"id": "line_1", "type": "number_line", ...}
]

Step 2+ workspace (array with inherited property):
"workspace": {
  "inherited": true,  // or false
  "tangibles": [...]
}

TRUE inheritance (inherited: true):
- Same tangibles, modified state (e.g., ticks added, labels placed)
- Example: "Step 1: Blank line. Step 2: Line now has tick marks at fourths"

FALSE/NO inheritance (inherited: false or omit):
- Different tangibles entirely (e.g., bars → lines, one line → multiple lines)
- Example: "Step 1: Reference bar with option bars. Step 2: Two number lines stacked"
```

**Step Content Fields:**

Each step object contains:

**step_id:** (number) Sequential identifier (1, 2, 3, ...)

**dialogue:** Create conversational setup (10-30 words)
- IMPORTANT: Try to use the same verb as the prompt (if prompt says "Place", dialogue can say "Let's place..." or "place")
- If application_context exists, incorporate it naturally
- If prompt contains scaffolding hints, move them to dialogue
- Reference visual elements generically ("number line", "bars", "circles")
- **CRITICAL - Singular vs Plural**: Use plural language if multiple correct answers exist
  - Multiple correct answers → "Which bars show..." (not "Which bar shows...")
  - Single correct answer → "Which bar shows..." (not "Which bars show...")
- Use supportive, clear language
- Adjust scaffolding based on mastery_tier (support=most guidance, challenge=least)
- Follow <guide_design> "Problem Setup Dialogue" section

**prompt:** Create a self-explanatory, direct instruction that the student can solve with just the prompt alone
- The student should know exactly what fraction to work with by reading only the prompt. It's still a problem though, so don't give away the answer. Make this decision based on the skill being tested here: Student can verify equivalence by placing fractions at the same point on a number line
- If the prompt already meets these criteria, keep it as-is
- Strip any application_context (e.g., "Maya ate 1/4...") from the prompt and move it to dialogue instead
- Strip any scaffolding hints (e.g., "One interval from zero", "That's two spaces", "Count the intervals...") from the prompt and move them to dialogue instead
- **CRITICAL - Singular vs Plural**: Use plural language if multiple correct answers exist
  - Multiple correct answers → "Select ALL bars that..." (not "Select the bar that...")
  - Single correct answer → "Select the bar that..." (not "Select ALL bars")
- Keep prompt focused on the core mathematical task (e.g., "Place three-fourths on the number line.")

**interaction_tool:** Derive from action_description

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**
- **click_choice/multi_click_choice**: ONLY for text-based MCQ options (e.g., "Yes/No", "Same/Different", "1/3, 2/3, 3/3" as text)
- **select/multi_select**: For selecting VISUAL tangibles (bars, lines, shapes, grids)
  - Key phrases: "select bar", "clicks to select bar", "select the number line", "choose which shape"
  - If workspace has visual objects (bars/lines/shapes) and student picks one → use `select`

**CRITICAL: Single vs Multi Selection Tools:**
- **Before choosing tool**: Check how many correct answers exist in the workspace
- **Multiple correct answers** (e.g., two bars both show equivalent fractions):
  - Use "multi_select" or "multi_click_choice"
  - Dialogue and prompt should already use plural language (see sections above)
- **Single correct answer**:
  - Use "select" or "click_choice"
  - Dialogue and prompt should use singular language
- **Example ERROR**: workspace has bar_a (3/6) and bar_b (1/2), both equivalent to 2/4
  - WRONG: tool="select", dialogue="Which bar shows...", prompt="Select the equivalent bar", answer=["bar_a", "bar_b"]
  - RIGHT: tool="multi_select", dialogue="Which bars show...", prompt="Select ALL equivalent bars", answer=["bar_a", "bar_b"]

Map action_description to tool:
- "Place point(s)" / "Point at tick marks" → "place_point"
- "Drag label(s)" / "Label tick marks by dragging" → "drag_label"
- "Select from text options" / "Choose text answer" → "click_choice" (text-only, NOT visual tangibles)
- "Clicks to select bar" / "Select bar/line/shape" → "select" (ONE visual tangible, NOT text)
- "Select multiple bars/lines/shapes" → "multi_select" (MULTIPLE visual tangibles)
- "Place ticks on number line" → "place_tick"
- "Cut shape into parts" → "cut_shape"
- "Shade parts" → "shade"

**Pattern for new actions:**
If you encounter an action_description not listed above:
1. Identify the verb (e.g., "Draw", "Rotate", "Match", "Connect")
2. Identify the object (e.g., "lines", "shapes", "dots", "segments")
3. Create tool name: `{verb}_{object}` in snake_case (e.g., "Draw lines between points" → "draw_line")
4. Follow these conventions:
   - Actions on multiple items use plural: "select" vs "multi_select"
   - Dragging/moving actions: use "drag_{object}"
   - Placing/positioning: use "place_{object}"
   - Selecting/clicking: use "select" or "click_{object}"
   - Modifying properties: use "{verb}_{object}" (e.g., "color_region", "resize_bar")
5. Add a brief clarification in parentheses describing what the student does

**workspace:** Parse workspace_description into structured object with tangibles array and optional inherited flag

**CRITICAL: You MUST strictly follow ALL visual schemas defined in <visuals>. Consult the documentation for each shape type to understand:**
- Required and optional properties
- Valid value ranges and types
- Constraints (e.g., max number of instances, allowed denominators)
- Structural relationships (e.g., points must correspond to ticks)
- **ONLY use fields defined in visuals.md for each toy type** - do NOT add fields that aren't documented in visuals.md
- The ONLY exceptions are the universal fields: `id`, `type`, and `role` (defined below)

**Workspace Structure:**
- **For Step 1**: Array of tangibles (no inherited field needed)
- **For Step 2+**: Add `inherited` boolean field:
  - `true` if same tangibles with modified state
  - `false` or omit if completely different tangibles

**Universal Tangible Fields:**

ALL tangible types (number_line, fraction_strip, etc.) support these universal fields IN ADDITION to their toy-specific properties:

- **id**: Unique identifier (e.g., "line_1", "bar_a", "bar_b")
- **type**: Toy type matching visuals.md (e.g., "number_line", "fraction_strip")
- **role**: (REQUIRED) Workspace context marker indicating how this tangible is used
  - `"reference"` - Non-interactable, for display/comparison only (student cannot select or modify)
  - `"student_interaction"` - Interactable, student can select/modify this tangible
  - **Keywords to identify reference tangibles**: "reference bar", "at top", "for comparison", "marked read-only", "pre-placed", "shows target", "for display only"
  - **Default**: If unclear, most tangibles are `"student_interaction"` unless explicitly marked as reference
  - **IMPORTANT**: Always add the `role` field to ALL tangibles. This field is REQUIRED for proper transformation to Godot format.
- **description**: (REQUIRED) Natural language description directly derived from workspace_description
  - Extract the phrase from workspace_description that describes this specific tangible
  - Examples from workspace_description:
    - "A fraction bar to show 1/2 shaded" → description: "Fraction bar showing 1/2 shaded"
    - "Number line with point marked at 2/3" → description: "Number line with point at 2/3"
    - "Bar with 2 out of 4 sections shaded" → description: "Bar with 2/4 shaded"
    - "Blank number line from 0 to 1" → description: "Blank number line 0-1"
  - **This field is the SOURCE OF TRUTH** - all technical fields must match this description

**Parsing Natural Language to Structured Workspace:**
1. Identify the shape type(s) mentioned in workspace_description
2. **For each tangible, extract its description from workspace_description and write the `description` field FIRST**
   - This captures what the workspace_description says this tangible should show
   - Example: workspace_description says "Bar A shows 2/4, Bar B shows 1/2" → Bar A gets description: "Bar showing 2/4 shaded"
3. Look up the corresponding schema in <visuals> to see what fields are valid for this toy type
4. **Use the description to determine ALL technical field values**:
   - "Bar showing 2/4 shaded" → intervals: "1/4", intervals_is_shaded: [0, 1]
   - "Number line with point at 1/2" → points: ["1/2"]
   - This ensures the technical fields exactly match what the description says
5. Extract other property values from the text description (e.g., "from 0 to 1" → range: [0, 1])
6. **Add universal fields**: `id`, `type`, `role`, and `description` (for ALL tangibles)
7. **Add ONLY toy-specific fields defined in visuals.md** - do NOT add any other fields
8. Build the workspace element following the exact schema structure from visuals.md
9. For special elements (MCQ choices, drag palettes), check if interaction_tool requires them and add accordingly

**Special Workspace Elements:**
- **choices**: Add ONLY when interaction_tool is "click_choice" (text-based MCQ)
  Format: {"type": "choices", "options": [{"id": "a", "text": "..."}, ...]}
  Use "allow_multiple": true for multi-select text questions
  **NEVER add choices for "select" or "multi_select" tools** - those select visual tangibles directly

- **palette**: Add when interaction_tool is "drag_label"
  Format: {"type": "palette", "labels": ["1/4", "2/4", ...]}
  Optional quantities array for label availability

**correct_answer:** Object with:
- value: The expected answer (format depends on interaction_tool)
  - **Count correct answers first**: This determines tool choice (see interaction_tool section)
  - **Single correct answer**: value is string or single-item array; tool should be "select" or "click_choice"
  - **Multiple correct answers**: value is array with 2+ items; tool MUST be "multi_select" or "multi_click_choice"
  - If multiple tangibles/options are equivalent (e.g., two bars showing 2/3), either:
    - Make options visually distinct (different fractions) to keep single correct answer, OR
    - Use multi_select/multi_click_choice with array of ALL correct answers (and plural language in dialogue/prompt)
  - **NEVER have ambiguous correct answers** (e.g., single-select tool with multiple equivalent options)
- context: Brief explanation of why this is correct

**success_path_dialogue:** Rotate through the success_dialogue examples from the template here: ["Right there. Two fourths lands at the same point as one half.", "Yes. They're at the same position — equivalent.", "Correct. Same spot means same amount.", "You proved it. Three sixths equals one half."]

## IMPORTANT NOTES

### Structure Rules:
- Each problem instance creates ONE output item
- Metadata fields (problem_id, mastery_tier, etc.) always at TOP LEVEL
- **ALWAYS include `steps` array** (even for single-step problems)
- **Single-step (no_of_steps = 1)**: `steps` array has ONE item
- **Multi-step (no_of_steps > 1)**: `steps` array has N items

### Multi-Step Requirements:
- Parse "Step N:" markers from workspace_description
- Parse "(step N)" markers from action_description
- Split prompt on "then" or commas
- For Step 2+: workspace becomes object with `inherited` field and `tangibles` array
- Each step has unique step_id (1, 2, 3, ...)

### General:
- Keep dialogue conversational and supportive
- Parse workspace descriptions carefully to create accurate tangible structures
- Extract all fractions/denominators from variables_used into fractions array
