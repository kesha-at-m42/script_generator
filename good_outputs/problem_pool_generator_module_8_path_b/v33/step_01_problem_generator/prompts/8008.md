## MASTERY TIERS

Difficulty increases through: **parameter complexity**, **visual complexity**, **scaffolding**, and **cognitive demand**.

### Support
**Simplified parameters with additional scaffolding**

- **Purpose:** Build confidence after struggle; provide accessible entry point
- **Target:** 15-20% of problem pool
- **Key Principle:** Simpler versions of the same skill, NOT different concepts
- **Parameter Complexity:** Easiest variables (halves, unit fractions, smaller denominators like 2-3)
- **Visual Design:** Single, straightforward visual with obvious, high-contrast features
- **Scaffolding:** Additional guides, hints visible, or reference visuals shown
- **Cognitive Demand:** Simple recognition or one-step action with heavy guidance
- **Mastery Status:** Does NOT count toward mastery (support only)

### Confidence
**Very simple problems with maximum scaffolding**

- **Purpose:** Build confidence before retry; early practice with clear scaffolding
- **Target:** 10-15% of problem pool
- **Key Principle:** The simplest possible version of the skill being taught
- **Parameter Complexity:** Common, familiar variables (thirds, fourths, simple unit fractions)
- **Visual Design:** Single visual with clear, obvious features
- **Scaffolding:** Maximum scaffolding (labeled tick marks, highlighted features, reference examples)
- **Cognitive Demand:** Direct application of one concept with step-by-step guidance
- **Mastery Status:** Does NOT count toward mastery (confidence building only)

### Baseline
**Core grade-level problems; mastery expectations begin here**

- **Purpose:** Standard mastery assessment at grade-level expectations
- **Target:** 40-50% of problem pool (largest portion)
- **Key Principle:** Problems vary in difficulty but stay within grade-level expectations
- **Parameter Complexity:** Mix of common and less common variables (halves through sixths, mix of unit and non-unit fractions)
- **Visual Design:** May include 2-3 visuals or moderate contrast between options
- **Scaffolding:** Standard presentation without extra support
- **Cognitive Demand:** Clear task requiring understanding, not just pattern-matching
- **Mastery Status:** COUNTS TOWARD MASTERY

### Stretch
**More challenging parameters with less scaffolding**

- **Purpose:** Challenge students who show baseline mastery; deeper exploration
- **Target:** 20-25% of problem pool (second largest portion)
- **Key Principle:** Extends thinking without introducing new concepts
- **Parameter Complexity:** Less familiar variables (sixths, eighths) or multiple fractions to consider
- **Visual Design:** Multiple visuals (3-4) with reduced contrast, requiring careful comparison
- **Scaffolding:** Less scaffolding; fewer labeled elements
- **Cognitive Demand:** Multi-step reasoning, comparing multiple representations, or inverse operations
- **Mastery Status:** COUNTS TOWARD MASTERY

### Challenge
**Most difficult parameters with no scaffolding**

- **Purpose:** Enrichment for advanced students
- **Target:** 5-10% of problem pool
- **Key Principle:** Extends thinking to maximum complexity without leaving the core concept
- **Parameter Complexity:** Most complex variables (eighths, larger numerators, mixed denominators) or abstract scenarios
- **Visual Design:** Many visuals (4+) with subtle differences, or abstract/decontextualized representations
- **Scaffolding:** No scaffolding; may include distractors
- **Cognitive Demand:** Complex reasoning, ordering, transferring across contexts, or sophisticated pattern recognition
- **Mastery Status:** COUNTS TOWARD MASTERY

  ## Shape: Number Line

  A 1D visual representation showing equal intervals with tick marks and fraction positions.

  ### Properties
  - **State**: Can be whole (showing only endpoints) or divided with tick marks
  - **Range**: The numerical bounds [start, end], typically [0, 1] but can extend to show fractions greater than 1
  - **Role**: Determines if this is a reference visual (non-interactable) or an option/target (interactable)
    - **Reference**: For display only - cannot be selected, clicked, or modified (e.g., reference bar at top for comparison)
    - **Option/Target**: Default - can be selected, clicked, or modified by student (e.g., selectable answer choices)
    - Mark reference tangibles in workspace descriptions as "reference bar" or "for comparison only"

  ### Ticks
  Marks at specific positions on the number line.

  #### ticks
  Vertical marks indicating specific positions.
  - **Type**: Fraction OR array of fractions
  - **Description**: Marks at fraction positions on the number line
  - **Always includes**: Ticks at start and end points (e.g., 0 and 1)
  - **is_read_only**: Boolean indicating whether the tick is interactable (default: `false`). Set to `true` for tick marks that should not accept dragged labels (e.g., endpoints, already labeled ticks)

  #### points
  Additional visual emphasis by placing dots or points on specific ticks.

  - **Type**: Array of fractions (must correspond to tick positions)
  - **Description**: Highlights specific ticks with dots

  #### labels
  Text annotations on specific ticks.

  - **Type**: Array of fractions (must correspond to tick positions)
  - **Description**: Display fraction values as text at tick positions
  - **Boolean**: Enable/disable labels for all ticks

  ### Example Configurations

  **Basic number line with thirds:**
  ```
  range: [0, 1]
  ticks: [0, 1/3, 2/3, 1]
  // Creates: Number line from 0 to 1 with tick marks at thirds
  ```

  **Number line with partly labeled and emphasized points:**
  ```
  range: [0, 1]
  ticks: [0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1]
  points: [1/4, 3/4]
  labels: [1/4, 3/4]
  // Creates: Number line with fourths, highlighting and labeling 1/4 and 3/4
  ```

  ### Constraints
  - Number lines are always labeled with start and end values (typically 0 and 1)
  - Denominators are commonly limited to: 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8
  - Maximum of 3 number lines can be shown for comparison
  - Points and labels can only be attached to existing ticks

  ### Allowed Student Actions
  - **Place tick**: Place ticks on an unpartitioned or partially partitioned number bar. For example, divide this line into thirds or place a tick at 3/5.
  - **Select**: Select number lines (1 or more) that match the question requirements. For example, select the number line showing fifths.
  - **Place point**: Place points at specific tick marks (1 or more). For example, place a point at 3/5 or place 3/5 on the line.
  - **Label**: Label tick marks (1 or more) by dragging fraction labels (1 or more) to them. For example, place/drag the correct label on the given tick mark or place/drag the given fraction on the correct number line.

---
  ## Shape: Fraction Strip

  A 1D rectangular bar representing a whole, shown as a horizontal strip that can be divided into equal sections.

  ### Properties
  - **State**: Can be whole (undivided) or divided into equal sections
  - **Range**: The numerical bounds [start, end], typically [0, 1] but can extend to show fractions greater than 1
  - **Role**: Determines if this is a reference visual (non-interactable) or an option/target (interactable)
    - **Reference**: For display only - cannot be selected, clicked, or modified (e.g., reference bar at top showing target fraction)
    - **Option/Target**: Default - can be selected, clicked, or modified by student (e.g., bars to shade, option bars to select from)
    - Mark reference tangibles in workspace descriptions as "reference bar" or "for comparison only"
  
  ### Intervals
  The distinct sections (parts) created by dividing the strip.

  #### intervals
  Interval sizes defining how the strip is divided.

  - **Type**: Fraction OR array of fractions
  - **Description**: Defines the size of each section in the strip
  - **Uniform spacing**: Use single fraction (e.g., "1/3" creates 3 equal sections)
  - **Non-uniform spacing**: Use array of fractions (e.g., ["1/4", "1/4", "1/2"])

  #### intervals_is_shaded
  Which sections are shaded.

  - **Type**: Boolean OR array of integers (indices)
  - **Description**: Specifies which sections should be shaded
  - **Boolean**: `true` shades all sections, `false` shades none

  #### intervals_is_read_only
  Which sections are non-interactable.

  - **Type**: Boolean OR array of integers (indices)
  - **Description**: Makes specific sections non-interactable
  - **Default**: `false`

  ### Example Configurations

  **Basic fraction strip with thirds:**
  ```
  range: [0, 1]
  intervals: "1/3"
  // Creates: Strip divided into 3 equal sections
  ```

  **Fraction strip with shaded sections:**
  ```
  range: [0, 1]
  intervals: "1/4"
  intervals_is_shaded: [0, 2]
  // Creates: Strip with fourths, first and third sections shaded
  ```

  ### Constraints
  - Denominators are commonly limited to: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 8
  - Maximum of 3 fraction strips can be shown for comparison

  ### Allowed Student Actions
  - **Cut**: Divide the whole strip into intervals. For example, divide this strip into thirds.
  - **Select**: Select fraction strips (1 or more) that match the question requirements. For example, select the strip showing fifths.

### Block 4: Instructions
Purpose: Step-by-step task instructions
Cacheable: Yes

# TASK INSTRUCTIONS


## TASK

You will receive a problem template that defines a specific type of mathematical interaction.
Your task is to generate concrete problem instances that create meaningful variation across:
1. **Parameter values** (fractions tested)
2. **Mastery tiers** (difficulty levels 0-4)

## INPUT STRUCTURE

The problem template contains:
- **template_id**: Unique identifier for this template type
- **problem_type**: Descriptive statement of the problem type addressed in the template
- **workspace_description**: What the student sees on screen
- **prompt_examples**: Sample variations of how to ask the question
- **action_description**: What the student does to solve (maps to allowed actions from visuals.md)
  - Some templates may list multiple possible interactions (e.g., "Point at tick marks OR Label tick marks by dragging")
  - Use these different interactions to create meaningful variation across questions
- **no_of_steps**: The number of steps required to complete the problem
- **target_count**: The exact number of problem instances to generate from this template
- **parameter_coverage**: The mathematical parameters to vary (fractions, denominators, etc.)

## GENERATION STRATEGY

### Number of Problems to Generate

**CRITICAL: Generate exactly target_count problem instances**
- The template specifies target_count - this is the exact number of problems you must create
- Example: If target_count = 10, generate exactly 10 problem instances
- Distribute problems across allowed mastery tiers and parameter values
- Maximize variation while meeting the target_count requirement

### Parameter Repetition Rules

**The Golden Rule: Always generate exactly target_count problems**

**Step-by-step approach:**
1. **First pass**: Cover each parameter once, distributing across allowed mastery tiers
2. **If target_count > number of parameters**: Repeat parameters with DIFFERENT prompt_example phrasings
3. **NEVER repeat**: Same parameter with same prompt_example phrasing
4. **Additional variation**: Use different workspace configurations, actions (if template allows multiple), and application contexts

**Example:**
```
Parameters: ["1/2", "1/3", "1/5", "1/6"]
Tiers: ["BASELINE", "SUPPORT"]
Target: 6 problems
Prompt examples: ["Place {fraction}", "Show {fraction}", "Mark {fraction}"]

Solution:
- BASELINE: 1/3 (phrasing 1), 1/5 (phrasing 1), 1/6 (phrasing 1), 1/5 (phrasing 2)
- SUPPORT: 1/2 (phrasing 1), 1/3 (phrasing 2)

Valid: Same parameter appears twice but with different phrasings
Invalid: 1/3 appears twice with "Place one-third" both times
```

**MCQ/Select Questions:**
- Create multiple questions with varied option sets
- Same parameter can appear multiple times if option sets differ meaningfully

### Axes of Variation

**1. Parameters:** Use values from parameter_coverage. Track in variables_used (use "fractions" as key when possible).

**CRITICAL for Parameter Repetition:**
- When you need to repeat a parameter to reach target_count, you MUST use a different prompt_example phrasing
- Track which prompt_example you used for each parameter to avoid repetition

**2. Mastery Tiers:** ONLY use tiers from template's mastery_tier field. Distribute problems across allowed tiers.

**3. Visuals:** Vary workspace configurations, labeling schemes, tick mark densities.
   - **CRITICAL: All visual elements in a workspace MUST be visually distinct**
   - If workspace has multiple number lines/shapes, each MUST have different visual characteristics
   - For comparison tasks: Each number line must have a point at a DIFFERENT fraction position
   - INVALID: Three lines all with points at 2/6 (visually identical)
   - VALID: First line point at 2/6, second line point at 5/6, third line point at 1/6 (all distinct)

**4. Actions:** When template lists multiple interactions (e.g., "Point OR Label"), alternate between them.

### Mapping to Allowed Actions

Reference **visuals.md** for allowed student actions. Map template actions to closest approved action that sustains the pedagogical goal.

**MCQs:** Allowed student action (not in visuals.md). Students select from array of options. Specify options in workspace_description.

### Option Design Best Practices

**CRITICAL: Respect Template's Option Count and visuals.md Constraints**
- **visuals.md constraints take precedence** - check visuals.md for maximum allowed elements (e.g., max bars, max lines)
- If template specifies "3 options" or "from 3 options", generate EXACTLY 3 options - not 4
- If template specifies "4 options", generate EXACTLY 4 options
- Count carefully: "Reference bar + three option bars" = 4 total bars (1 reference, 3 options)
- Do NOT add extra options beyond what the template specifies OR what visuals.md allows

**Applies to all selection-based questions (MCQ text options AND select visual tangibles):**
- **Standard: Provide 3-4 options** for meaningful variation and reduced guessing (ONLY if template doesn't specify)
  - MCQ: 3-4 text choices
  - Select: 3-4 visual tangibles (bars, lines, shapes) to choose from
- **Binary questions (2 options):** Allowed ONLY for SUPPORT or CONFIDENCE tiers
  - NOT allowed for BASELINE, STRETCH, or CHALLENGE tiers
- Always ensure at least ONE correct option (multiple correct allowed only if intentional for multi-select)

**CRITICAL: Distractors Must Be Clearly Incorrect**
- Distractors should be challenging but NEVER mathematically correct or ambiguous
- Each distractor must be definitively wrong - not "could be correct from another perspective"
- Bad distractor example: "The numerator and denominator both doubled" when asking WHY 2/3 = 4/6 (this is actually a correct mathematical fact)
- Good distractor example: "Six is larger than three" (mathematically irrelevant to equivalence)
- Test each option: If you can defend it as correct using valid mathematical reasoning, don't use it as a distractor
- Include mix of distractor types:
  - One similar to correct (close denominator/numerator, or visually similar) but still definitively wrong
  - One obviously incorrect
  - One misconception-based (e.g., wrong interval counting, inverted fraction)

- Avoid equivalent representations UNLESS the learning objective is about equivalence
  - MCQ: Don't have both "2/4" and "1/2" unless testing equivalence (e.g., "Which equals 1?")
  - Select: Don't have two bars both showing 2/3 unless testing "select all that show 2/3"

**CRITICAL: Correct Answer Must Exist in Workspace**
- **Selection/MCQ:** The workspace/options MUST include the correct answer
  - ✗ INVALID: "Which line shows thirds?" → workspace shows [fifths, fourths, sixths]
  - ✓ VALID: "Which line shows thirds?" → workspace shows [fifths, thirds, sixths]
- **Verification:** Check that students can actually select the correct answer from what's shown

**CRITICAL: Single vs Multiple Correct Answers**
- **Default: ONLY ONE correct answer** - MCQ options should have exactly ONE correct answer
  - ✓ VALID: "Why does 3/3 = 1?" → ONE correct explanation among options
  - ✗ INVALID: Multiple options that are all logically correct (e.g., "all parts = 1 whole" AND "numerator = denominator")
- **If multiple answers ARE correct:**
  - EITHER: Rewrite options so only ONE is correct (preferred)
  - OR: Change action_description to "Student selects multiple answers from options" (multi-select)
- **Design tip:** For conceptual questions, avoid including both conceptual AND mathematical explanations that are both correct

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

**1. problem_instance_id:** Sequential (1, 2, 3...)

**2. template_id:** Copy from template

**3. problem_type:** Copy verbatim from template

**4. no_of_steps:** Copy from template (if present). This indicates how many steps are required to complete the problem (typically 1 or 2)

**5. workspace_description:** Visual setup that ONLY uses features defined in visuals.md
   - Refer to <visuals> documentation for allowed workspace elements
   - Do NOT invent or describe visual features not listed in visuals.md
   - Only describe: tick marks, points, labels, range - nothing else

**6. action_description:** Describe what the student does and include the correct answer
   - Map template's action to closest allowed action from visuals.md (or MCQ)
   - Be specific about which element/answer is correct
   - Example: "Student selects Bar B (2/4) as the equivalent fraction" instead of just "Select"
   - If template lists multiple action options, alternate between them for variety

**7. prompt:** Student-facing question
   - **CRITICAL: Use ONLY sentence structures and verbs from prompt_examples**
   - Variation = swap parameter values only
   - VALID: "Place one-fourth" when example is "Place one-third"
   - INVALID: "Put one-fourth" or "Show one-fourth" when example is "Place"
   - Rotate through all prompt_examples structures
   - **CRITICAL: Never use the same prompt_example phrasing for the same parameter value**
   - Example: If "1/3" was asked as "Place one-third", next "1/3" must use different phrasing like "Show one-third" or "Mark one-third"

**8. mastery_tier:** ONLY use values from template's mastery_tier field in UPPERCASE (e.g., if template has ["BASELINE"], all problems use "BASELINE")

**9. variables_used:** Parameter values (use "fractions" as key when possible)

**10. application_context:** (ONLY for "apply" mastery_verb)
   - Create variety by varying subjects while keeping sentence structure the same
   - Names: Vary between Sam, Alex, Maya, Jordan, Hannah, etc.
   - Objects: If one says "chocolate bars", alternate to "cinnamon sticks", "vanilla wafers", "sugar cookies", etc.
   - Actions/Subjects: If one says "frog jumped", alternate to "cricket hopped", "grasshopper leaped", "rabbit jumped", etc.
   - Keep the sentence structure consistent but vary the nouns and subjects
   - Example variations:
     - "Sam walked 5 spaces..." → "Alex walked 5 spaces...", "Jordan walked 5 spaces..."
     - "Recipe asks for chocolate bars" → "Recipe asks for cinnamon sticks", "Recipe asks for vanilla wafers"
     - "Frog jumped 6 fourths" → "Cricket hopped 6 fourths", "Grasshopper leaped 6 fourths"

**11. options:** (ONLY for MCQ problems - when workspace_description mentions "multiple choice" or template has mcq_options field)
   - **CRITICAL: If template has mcq_options field, use those templates to generate options**
   - Generate an array of answer options exactly as they'll be presented to the student
   - Follow template's option count specification (3-4 options typically)
   - Include exactly ONE correct option and the rest as distractors
   - Use mcq_options templates from template, substituting parameter values ({items}, {fraction1}, {fraction2}, etc.)
   - Ensure distractors are clearly incorrect (see "Distractors Must Be Clearly Incorrect" section)
   - For same_whole_scenarios: use mcq_options.same_whole_scenarios
   - For different_whole_scenarios: use mcq_options.different_whole_scenarios
   - Example options array: ["Yes, because the ribbons are the same size and 1/2 equals 2/4.", "No, because 1/2 and 2/4 look different.", "No, because they are divided into different numbers of pieces.", "Yes, because they are both ribbons."]

## QUALITY CHECKLIST

**Parameter Coverage:**
- Generate exactly target_count problems
- First pass: cover each parameter once, distributed across allowed tiers
- If target_count > parameters: repeat parameters with DIFFERENT prompt_example phrasings
- MCQ: Parameters can repeat if option sets differ meaningfully
- Use ONLY tiers from template's mastery_tier field

**Prompt Adherence:**
- Use ONLY sentence structures and verbs from prompt_examples
- Variation = swap parameter values ONLY
- No invented phrasings or new action verbs
- Never repeat same prompt_example phrasing for the same parameter

**Visual Variety:**
- Vary workspace descriptions across problems
- MCQ: Each option set has different combinations
- Actions: Alternate when template allows multiple

**STOP Signs:**
- ✗ Repeating same parameter with same prompt_example phrasing
- ✗ Generating more or fewer problems than target_count specifies
- ✗ Using tiers not in template's mastery_tier field
- ✗ Inventing new prompt language/verbs not in prompt_examples
- ✗ Identical option sets (MCQ)
- ✗ Binary questions (2 options) - always find a third option or use 3-4 options
- ✗ Binary questions at BASELINE, STRETCH, or CHALLENGE tiers (if binary MUST exist, only in SUPPORT or CONFIDENCE)
- ✗ Visually identical elements in workspace (e.g., two number lines with points at same position)
- ✗ Inventing visual features not in visuals.md (e.g., "dotted lines", "highlighted intervals", "shaded regions")

Generate problem instances NOW with maximum variation and quality!
