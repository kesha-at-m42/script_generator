Look at the sixths bar - it has 6 equal parts instead of 3. That means each third contains 2 sixths. So to show one-third using sixths, we need to shade 2 sections. That gives us two-sixths, which equals one-third. That's how we create equivalent fractions - we find how many of the smaller parts fit into the same amount of space."
