The right bar shows 4 out of 6 parts shaded - that's four sixths. Now here's the key: even though the parts are different sizes, look at the total shaded area. The shaded portion on the left bar takes up the same amount of space as the shaded portion on the right bar. They both fill the same length of the bar. So yes, two thirds and four sixths are equivalent - they represent the same amount. That's what equivalent fractions mean."
