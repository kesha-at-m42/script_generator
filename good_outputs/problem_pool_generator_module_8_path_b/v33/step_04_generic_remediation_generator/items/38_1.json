We need to find the halfway point there too. If we count from 0, we have 8 equal parts total to get to 1. Half of 8 is 4, so the halfway point is at 4/8. Place the point right there at 4/8 - it lines up exactly with where 1/2 is on the top line. That's how we see that four eighths and one half are at the same location."
