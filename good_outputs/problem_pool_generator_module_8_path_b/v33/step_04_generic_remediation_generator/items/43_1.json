Each of those intervals represents one third. One third means 1 out of 3 parts, so we count just 1 interval from 0. That puts us at the first tick mark after zero - that's where one third belongs. Notice how this lines up with two sixths on the top number line. That's how we locate one third on a number line divided into thirds."
