Look at the top line - one-half is right at the halfway point. Now on the bottom line, count the eighths: 1/8, 2/8, 3/8, 4/8. Four-eighths lands at exactly that same halfway position. Place your point at the 4/8 tick mark - it lines up perfectly with 1/2 above it. That's how we verify equivalent fractions - they occupy the same position on the number line."
