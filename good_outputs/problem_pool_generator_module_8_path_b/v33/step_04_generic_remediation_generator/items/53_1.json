To find the equivalent fraction, notice that each third in the top bar lines up with two sixths in your bar. So if 2 thirds are shaded above, we need to shade 4 sixths below - that's 4 out of 6 sections. Both fractions show the same amount. That's how equivalent fractions work - different numbers of parts, same amount shaded."
