Bar A shows only 1/3 shaded - that's less than 4/6. Bar C shows 3/6 shaded - that's also less than 4/6. But Bar B shows 2/3 shaded. Even though it's divided into thirds instead of sixths, 2/3 covers the same amount as 4/6. You can see the shading ends at the same place. The answer is Bar B. That's how we find equivalent fractions - different numbers can represent the same amount."
