It's divided into fourths, with tick marks at one-fourth, two-fourths, three-fourths. To find two-fourths, we need the tick mark that's in the same position as one-half on the top line. That's the second tick mark from zero - right here at two-fourths. See how one-half and two-fourths are at the exact same spot? That's what makes them equivalent fractions."
