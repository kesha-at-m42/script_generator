Now on the bottom line, we need to count three sixths from zero. Start at zero and count: one sixth, two sixths, three sixths. Three sixths lands right here at the third tick mark from zero. Notice how that lines up exactly with one half on the top line. That's because three sixths and one half are equivalent fractions - they name the same position."
