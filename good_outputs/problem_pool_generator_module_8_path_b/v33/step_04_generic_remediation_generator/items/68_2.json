One-half means 1 out of those 2 parts, which is the halfway point. That's right here at the middle tick mark between 0 and 1. When we place the point there, it lines up perfectly with the 2/4 point on the top line. That's how we verify that 2/4 and 1/2 are equivalent - they land at the same location."
