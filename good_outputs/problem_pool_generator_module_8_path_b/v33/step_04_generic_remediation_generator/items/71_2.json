We need to find which sixth is also at that halfway point. If we count the sixths, three-sixths lands right at the middle too - it's 3 out of 6 equal parts, which is half. So the point goes at three-sixths on the bottom line. That's how we show equivalent fractions - they land at the same position even though they have different numbers."
