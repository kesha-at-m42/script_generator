Even though they have different numbers of sections, look at how far the shading extends on each bar. The shaded portion reaches the same point on both bars - they cover the same amount of space. That's because 2/3 and 4/6 are equivalent fractions. They represent the same amount even though they're written with different numbers. That's how we compare fractions - by looking at the actual amount, not just the numbers."
