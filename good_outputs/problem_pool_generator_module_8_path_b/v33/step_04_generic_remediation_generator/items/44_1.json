To find the equivalent position, we need to count how many sixths get us to the same spot. Starting from 0, count the sixths: one sixth, two sixths, three sixths. Three sixths lands at exactly the same point as two thirds on the top line. That's why 3/6 and 2/3 are equivalent - they represent the same location. Place your point at three sixths."
