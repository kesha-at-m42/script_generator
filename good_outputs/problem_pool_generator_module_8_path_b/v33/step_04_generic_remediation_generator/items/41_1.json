Now imagine drawing a straight line down from that point to the bottom number line. Where does it land? It lands right at the second tick mark on the bottom line, which is two sixths. That's the answer - two sixths goes at the same position as one third because they're equivalent fractions. That's how we use number lines to see equivalent fractions."
