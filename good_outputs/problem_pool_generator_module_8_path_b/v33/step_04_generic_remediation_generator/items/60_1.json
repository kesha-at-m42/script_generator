Even though they have different denominators, we can still compare them by looking at the actual lengths. If you look at both bars, the shaded portion on the left covers exactly the same length as the shaded portion on the right. They line up perfectly. This means one third and two sixths are equivalent fractions - they represent the same amount. That's how we compare fractions with different denominators - by looking at the actual amounts they represent."
