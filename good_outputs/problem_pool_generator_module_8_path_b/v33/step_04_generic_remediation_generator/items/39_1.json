Two fourths means 2 of those parts from zero. If we count: zero to the first tick is one fourth, then one fourth to the second tick is two fourths. That second tick is where two fourths goes. Notice how it lines up exactly with one half on the top line. That's how we show that two fourths and one half are at the same position."
