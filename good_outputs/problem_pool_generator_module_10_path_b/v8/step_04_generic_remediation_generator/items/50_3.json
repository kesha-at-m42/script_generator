Now look at the bottom number line - five-eighths is marked farther to the right. On a number line, when one fraction is to the left of another, it's smaller. Since three-eighths is to the left of five-eighths, three-eighths is less than five-eighths. So the correct symbol is less than. That's how we use number lines to compare fractions - the fraction farther to the right is always greater."
