That means we can compare them by looking at their positions on the number lines. One-sixth is just 1 interval from zero on the top number line. Four-sixths is 4 intervals from zero on the bottom number line. Since one-sixth is closer to zero, it's the smaller fraction. That means one-sixth is less than four-sixths. On the number line, points farther left are always smaller. So the answer is less than."
