When denominators are the same, we just compare the numerators. Bar 1 shows 3/10 - that's 3 shaded parts. Bar 2 shows 7/10 - that's 7 shaded parts. Bar 3 shows 9/10 - that's 9 shaded parts. From smallest to largest, we have 3, then 7, then 9. So the correct order from least to greatest is 3/10, 7/10, 9/10. That's how we compare fractions with the same denominator - just look at the numerators."
