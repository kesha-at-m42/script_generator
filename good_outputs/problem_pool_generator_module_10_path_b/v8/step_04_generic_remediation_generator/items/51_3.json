Now look at the bottom number line - three-fourths is three parts away from zero, much closer to one. On a number line, positions farther to the right are greater. Since three-fourths is to the right of one-fourth, three-fourths is greater. That means one-fourth is less than three-fourths, so we use the less than symbol. The answer is <. That's how we use number lines to compare fractions."
