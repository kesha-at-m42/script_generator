That means both fractions are divided into eighths, which are the same size pieces. Since the pieces are the same size, we just need to compare how many pieces each fraction has. 5/8 has 5 pieces and 2/8 has 2 pieces. Since 5 is greater than 2, we have more pieces in 5/8, making it the greater fraction. The correct explanation is: Both fractions show eighths. 5 > 2, so 5/8 is greater. That's how we compare fractions with the same denominator - we compare the numerators."
