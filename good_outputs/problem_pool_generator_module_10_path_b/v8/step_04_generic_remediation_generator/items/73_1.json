That means both are divided into twelfths - the exact same size pieces. Since the pieces are the same size, we compare by looking at how many pieces each fraction has. The numerators tell us that: 9/12 has 9 pieces and 4/12 has 4 pieces. Since 9 is greater than 4, and we're counting the same-sized pieces, 9/12 is greater than 4/12. That's the key - when denominators are equal, compare the numerators to see which fraction is greater."
