Bar A has 2 eighths shaded - that's the smallest amount. Bar B has 5 eighths shaded - that's in the middle. Bar C has 7 eighths shaded - that's the largest amount. So from smallest to largest, the order is 2/8, then 5/8, then 7/8. That's how we order fractions with the same denominator - we compare the numerators to see which has more parts."
