Both fractions have the same denominator - sixths - so we can compare them by looking at their positions. Two-sixths is only 2 parts away from zero, while five-sixths is 5 parts away from zero. Five-sixths is much farther from zero, which means it's the greater fraction. So two-sixths is less than five-sixths, and we use the less than symbol. The answer is the less than symbol. That's how we compare fractions - the one farther from zero on the number line is greater."
