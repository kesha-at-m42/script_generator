Three-fourths means we count 3 of those parts from 0. Starting at 0, we count: first tick mark is one-fourth, second tick mark is two-fourths, and the third tick mark is three-fourths. That third tick mark is where three-fourths goes. That's how we locate fractions - the numerator tells us how many parts to count from zero."
