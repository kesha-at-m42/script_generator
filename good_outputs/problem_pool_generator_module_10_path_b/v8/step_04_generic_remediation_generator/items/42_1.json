Bar A shows 4/12 - that has the smallest numerator and the least shading. Bar B shows 7/12 - that's in the middle. Bar C shows 10/12 - that has the largest numerator and the most shading. So from smallest to largest, the order is 4/12, 7/12, 10/12. That's how we order fractions with the same denominator - we compare numerators."
