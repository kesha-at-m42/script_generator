I count 7 equal intervals from 0 to 1, so the denominator is 7. This means we're working with sevenths. Now for the numerator - we count how many of those intervals from 0 to where we need to place the point. We need 2 intervals from zero, so we count 1, 2, and place our point right here at the second tick mark. That's two-sevenths. That's how we locate fractions - denominator first by counting equal intervals from 0 to 1, then numerator by counting intervals from 0."
