Bar 1 has 1 shaded part, which is 1/10. Bar 2 has 4 shaded parts, which is 4/10. Bar 3 has 6 shaded parts, which is 6/10. The smallest fraction is the one with the fewest shaded parts - that's 1/10. Next comes 4/10 with more shaded parts. The largest is 6/10 with the most shaded parts. So the order from smallest to largest is 1/10, 4/10, 6/10. That's how we order fractions with the same denominator - we compare the numerators to see which has fewer or more parts."
