That means both fractions are made of the same size pieces, tenths. When the pieces are the same size, we just compare how many pieces we have. Since 7 is greater than 3, that means 7 tenths is greater than 3 tenths. So 7/10 > 3/10. That's how we compare fractions with the same denominator - we compare the numerators."
