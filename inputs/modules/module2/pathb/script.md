**ERROR PATHS:**  
 🔴 **Misconception\_\#6 \[Meta\_Remediation\]:** \[If selects 1/6\] "I can see why you might think that \- 6 is bigger than 3\. But look at the actual pieces. When we divide into 6 parts instead of 3, each piece gets smaller." *\[Visual: Pieces pulse to show size difference\]*

**First Error:** 🟠 **Light Remediation \[Meta\_Remediation\]:** "Look at the actual size of the shaded parts, not just the numbers."

**Second Error:** 🟠 **Medium Remediation \[Meta\_Remediation\]:** “et me help you compare. Watch \- the piece from the 3-part bar is twice as big as the piece from the 6-part bar. Which one is larger?" *\[Visual: Outline Comparison of pieces from each bar\]*

**Third Error:** 🟣 **Heavy Remediation \[Meta\_Remediation\] \[Modeling\]:** "When we split into 3 parts, each piece is this big \[highlights\]. When we split into 6 parts, each piece is half that size \[highlights\]. So 1/3 is bigger. I'll select it." \[System selects 1/3\] 

⚫ **Guide:** "More parts means smaller pieces, even though 6 is a bigger number than 3."

---

## **INTERACTION 8: Pattern Confirmation**

🔵 **Visual:** \[CLEAR\] Four bars appear stacked vertically, all same total length:

* 1/2 (largest shaded piece)

**Prompt:** Click on each bar in order, starting with the biggest piece and ending with the smallest.

\[Student clicks bars in sequence\]

**SUCCESS PATH:**  
 ⚫ **Guide:** "Yes. "When the bottom number gets bigger, each piece gets smaller. If you're splitting the same whole thing into MORE pieces, each piece has to be smaller."

**ERROR PATHS:**  
**First Error:** 🟠 **Light Remediation \[Meta\_Remediation\]:** "Try starting with the biggest shaded piece. Which one takes up the most space?"

**Second Error:** 🟠 **Medium Remediation \[Meta\_Remediation\]:** "Look: 1/2 splits into 2 big pieces. 1/6 splits into 6 tiny pieces. Try clicking from biggest to smallest." *\[Visual: Pieces pulse in size order\]*

**Third Error:** 🟣 **Heavy Remediation \[Meta\_Remediation\] \[Modeling\]:** "Watch me work through this: The bar with 2 parts has the biggest pieces \- I'll click 1/2 first. Then the bar with 3 parts is next biggest \- that's 1/3. Then 1/4, and finally ⅙, which is the tiniest. So here’s how I click through them all from biggest to smallest." \[System demonstrates sequence\] 

⚫ Guide: "See how the pattern works? The key idea to remember is this: in unit fractions, bigger bottom numbers always means smaller pieces."  
---

## **INTERACTION 9: Extending the Pattern**

**Prompt:** Click on the bar with the bigger piece of ‘cake’.

\[Student clicks on a bar\]

**SUCCESS PATH:**  
 ⚫ **Guide:** "Yes. When you cut the same cake into only 4 pieces, each piece is bigger than when you cut it into 8 pieces."

**ERROR PATHS:**  
 **First Error:** 🟠 **Light Remediation \[Meta\_Remediation\]:** "Look at the size of each piece. Remember that more cuts means smaller slices."

**Second Error:** 🟠 **Medium Remediation \[Meta\_Remediation\]:** Watch this comparison \- the 4-piece cake slice is twice the size of the 8-piece slice. Which piece would you rather have? *\[Visual: Outline Comparison of pieces from each bar\]*

**Third Error:** 🟣 **Heavy Remediation \[Meta\_Remediation\] \[Modeling\]:** "Let me show you by selecting the bigger piece. I'm choosing the 1/4 piece because when we cut the same cake into fewer pieces, each piece is bigger. 4 pieces means bigger slices than 8 pieces." *\[Visual: System selects 1/4\]*

*\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*
