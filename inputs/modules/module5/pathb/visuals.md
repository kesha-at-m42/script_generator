# Visual Constraints - Module 5 Path B

## Tangible Types
- Extended number lines

## Description
Extended number lines are the primary visual for this module. They show equal intervals with tick marks and fraction positions, and can extend beyond 1 to show fractions greater than one whole.

## Constraints
- Number lines are always labelled with 0 and 1
- All fractions are shown as positions on number lines
- Numerators can be less than, equal to, or greater than denominators
- Denominators of 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 determine number of equal intervals in the unit segment
- Number lines can extend beyond 1 to show fractions like 4/3 or 5/4, but not beyond 2
- A maximum of 3 number lines can be shown for comparison
- Tick marks can be labelled to identify fraction positions
