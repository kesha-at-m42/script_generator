## 1.9 SYNTHESIS (6-8 minutes)

**Detail Level:** Structure \+ parameters (AI writes dialogue)

### **Purpose**

Connect partitioning concepts across representations. Recognize patterns in equal parts. Discover the relationship between number of parts and part size. This is NOT more practice—it's connection-making and consolidation.

### **Parameters**

| Element | Specification |
| :---- | :---- |
| Interactions | 5 (4 connection tasks \+ metacognitive reflection) |
| Task Types | Size observation, Pattern Discovery, Real-World reasoning, Generalization |
| Remediation | Light only—mastery assumed |
| Tone | Reflective, warm, discovering together |
| Energy | Medium (not exhausted, not high-energy) |

### **Constraints**

| DO | DO NOT |
| :---- | :---- |
| Connection tasks (pattern, size observation, real-world) | More practice problems |
| Name principles students discovered | Introduce new procedures |
| Light remediation if needed | Extended teaching or Heavy remediation |
| Specific identity closure | Generic praise ("Great job\!") |
| Visual support for every task | Abstract discussion without visuals |
| Use grid arrays and hexagons (VPSS Toys) | Introduce new visual models |

### **Opening Frame**

* **Purpose:** Signal shift from practice to reflection/connection.  
* **Guide:** "You've learned a lot about equal parts. Let's discover how these ideas connect to even bigger patterns in math."

**Task S.1: Size Observation**

* **Purpose:** Surface the relationship between number of parts and part size through visual comparison.  
* **Visual:** Two grid arrays, same size:  
  * Array A: Partitioned into halves, 1 shaded (1/2)  
  * Array B: Partitioned into fourths, 1 shaded (1/4)  
* **Guide setup:** "Look at these two rectangles. They're the same size, but partitioned differently. Think about why it's important that both rectangles are the same size."  
* **Prompt:** "Which shaded part is bigger? Click the rectangle with the bigger shaded part."  
* **Correct Answer:** Array A (the half)  
* **On Correct:** "Yes. You spotted it."  
* **Connection (Guide states after task):** "This is a big idea in math—when we split one whole into more parts, each part gets smaller. When you have fewer parts, each part is bigger."

**Task S.2: Pattern Discovery (Equal vs Unequal)**

* **Purpose:** Apply the equal parts rule to identify what doesn't follow the rule. VPSS emphasis on visual verification.  
* **Visual:** Four shapes in grid:  
  * Grid array: halves (2 equal parts)  
  * Grid array: thirds (3 equal parts)  
  * Hexagon: thirds (3 equal parts)  
  * Grid array: 3 unequal parts  
* **Guide:** "Three of these shapes follow our rule about fractions. One breaks the rule."  
* **Prompt:** "Click the shape that breaks our pattern."  
* **Correct Answer:** The grid array with unequal parts  
* **On Correct:** "Right. That one has unequal parts. You used the rule of equal parts to solve a puzzle\!"

**Task S.3: Real-World Reasoning**

* **Purpose:** Apply size reasoning to real-world context.  
* **Visual:** Three grid arrays representing chocolate bars:  
  * Array A: Partitioned into fourths, 1 shaded  
  * Array B: Partitioned into thirds, 1 shaded  
  * Array C: Partitioned into sixths, 1 shaded  
* **Guide:** "Think about sharing things in real life. If these rectangles were chocolate bars to share with friends, which one gives each person the biggest piece?"  
* **Prompt:** "Click on the bar where each person would get the biggest piece."  
* **Correct Answer:** Array B (thirds—fewest parts means biggest pieces)  
* **On Correct:** "That's right."  
* **Connection (Guide states after task):** "You're using math to solve real problems. When we share with fewer people, each person gets a bigger part."

**Metacognitive Reflection**

* **Purpose:** Build awareness of reasoning strategies—open reflection, not multiple choice.  
* **Guide:** "Take a moment to think about how you figured that out. Did you compare the sizes of the shaded parts, or did you think about sharing with friends?"  
* **No prompt—reflective pause only.**

**Task S.4: Generalization**

* **Purpose:** Articulate the core principle that unifies all fraction work.  
* **Visual:** Four partitioned and shaded shapes:  
  * Grid array: 1/2  
  * Grid array: 1/4  
  * Hexagon: 1/3  
  * Grid array: 1/6  
* **Guide:** "Look at all these different fractions. They all follow one rule. What's the ONE thing that's always true about all of them?"  
* **Prompt:** "Click on the answer that tells what's always true about fractions."  
* **Options:**  
  * The parts must be equal  
  * There must be 4 parts  
  * One part must be bigger  
* **Correct Answer:** "The parts must be equal"  
* **On Correct:** "Yes\! Fractions are all about equal parts of a whole. That's what makes fractions work\!"

**Identity-Building Closure**

* **Purpose:** Specific, growth-oriented affirmation connecting to future learning.  
* **Guide:** "You've done amazing work\! You can recognize equal parts, create them, compare them, and even spot them in the real world. Next time, we'll use this understanding to name specific fractions and see how they relate to each other."
