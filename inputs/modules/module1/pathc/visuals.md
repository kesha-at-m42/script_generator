# Visual Constraints - Module 1 Path C

## Tangible Types
- Grid rectangles
- Pattern tiles
- Circles
- Squares
- Rectangles

## Description
This module uses various shapes that can be partitioned into equal parts. Grids and shapes are the primary visuals, with an emphasis on creating and identifying equal parts through partitioning.

## Constraints
- Grids can show 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 equal squares
- Rectangles can be solid (unpartitioned) or divided into equal parts (2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 parts)
- Circles can be solid or partitioned from the center (like pizza slices) into 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 equal parts
- Squares can be solid or divided into equal parts (typically 4 parts using grid pattern)
- All shapes can have parts shaded or unshaded
- A maximum of 4 shapes can be shown for comparison
- Partitioning lines must create equal parts to be considered correct
- Visual representations focus on area models, not number lines
