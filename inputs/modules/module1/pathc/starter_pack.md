# **MODULE 1 PATH C (VPSS)**

### **LEARNING GOAL(S):**

* Partition shapes into equal areas (2,3,4,6,8) and name parts; recognize that equal-size parts can be named with fractions. 
* Express each equal part as a unit fraction of the whole using fraction notation; partition into halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, eighths.

### **CORE CONCEPTS:** 

* Equal Parts 
* Defining the Whole

### **STANDARDS:** 

**Building On:** 2.G.A.3 
**Addressing:** 3.G.A.2, 3.NF.A.1 
**Building Toward:** 3.NF.A.2, 3.NF.A.2a

### **VOCABULARY STAGING:**

* Introduce partition, whole, equal parts during folding 
* Introduce fraction; show '1/...' notation only after parts are named

### **MISCONCEPTIONS:** 

\#1 \- Unequal Parts: Believing parts can be different sizes and still count as equal fractions 
\#2 \- Misidentifying the Whole: Losing track of what the '1' is; comparing parts of different wholes

**Purpose:** Activate prior knowledge about equal-sized pieces and create engagement 
**Core Fractions:** Halves (2 parts), Fourths (4 parts) 
**Primary Visual Tool:** Grid rectangles with pattern tiles 

## **OPENING HOOK**

⚫ **Guide:** "You know when you snap a chocolate bar and it breaks perfectly along those lines? Each piece ends up being exactly the same size. Today we're going to get really good at creating equal parts."



## **INTERACTION 1: Grid Recognition**

\[Option to add transition/framing: Let’s start by looking at how shapes can be split into the same size using grids.\]

🔵 **Visual:** \ Two grids appear side by side:

**Prompt:** Click on the number of parts in the first grid.

🔵 **Visual:** Number buttons appear below first grid: \[2\] \[4\] \[6\]

\[Student clicks on answer\]

**SUCCESS PATH:** 

⚫ **Guide:** "That's it \- 6 equal squares. See how each square is exactly the same size?"

**ERROR PATH:**

**ERROR PATHS:** 

🟠 **Light :** "Equal slices always start from the center point." 

🟠 **Medium :** "Remember, we're partitioning the WHOLE circle. Every line should go all the way across, passing through the center. That's how we get equal parts of the whole." *\[Visual: Lines extend fully across circle through center\]*

🟣 **Heavy :** "Here's the secret to circle partitioning: Find the center first. Now watch \- for halves, one line through it. For fourths, imagine a plus sign centered right there. See?

## **IDENTITY CLOSURE**

🔵 **Visual:** All visuals fade

⚫ **Guide:** "You practiced partitioning shapes into equal parts. You worked with halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, and eighths. When you make more parts, each piece gets smaller. These patterns stayed the same in every problem you tried. The equal parts you practiced are the foundation for fraction work. Good work today."

# **START-OF-DAY RECAP**

**Duration:** \~1 minute 
 **Purpose:** Bridge to today's learning and reinforce readiness 
 **When:** First script of the day 
 **Interactions:** 0 (orientation only) 

## **WELCOME & RE-ORIENTATION**

⚫ **Guide:** "Welcome back\! Today we're exploring something really useful in math \- how to divide things into equal parts so everyone gets exactly the same amount."

## **PRIOR LEARNING ACTIVATION**

⚫ **Guide:** "If you've ever shared a pizza or broken a chocolate bar with friends, you already know something about this idea. You know that fair sharing means everyone gets the same amount."

## **TODAY'S LEARNING FRAME**

⚫ **Guide:** "In this session, you'll learn how to create equal parts in any shape \- rectangles, circles, squares. You'll learn that mathematicians have a special way to name these equal parts. They're called fractions\!"

# **END-OF-DAY RECAP**

**Duration:** \~2 minutes 
 **Purpose:** Celebrate effort and growth 
 **When:** Last script of the day 
 **Interactions:** 1 (optional reflection)

## **EFFORT RECOGNITION**

⚫ **Guide:** "Nice work. You learned to partition shapes into equal parts \- halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, even eighths\!"


## **SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENT ACKNOWLEDGMENT**

⚫ **Guide:** "You learned that more parts means smaller pieces and you found out that fractions only work when all the parts are equal."

## **IDENTITY BUILDING**

⚫ **Guide:** "You practiced finding patterns in the problems. You checked whether parts were equal. You worked with wholes and their parts. These equal parts are what you'll use as you continue to work with fractions."

## **FUTURE PREVIEW**

⚫ **Guide:** "Next time, you'll learn the special mathematical names for these equal parts \- like how one part out of four is called one-fourth. You've built a strong foundation. Keep up this careful thinking\!"


⚫ **Guide:** "Great work this session\!"
