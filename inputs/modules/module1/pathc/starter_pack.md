**Version:** December 2025

```

module_id: M01 
path: C 
fractions_required: ["1/2", "1/3", "1/4", "1/6", "1/8"] 
shapes: ["grid arrays", "hexagons"]

```

## 1.0 THE ONE THING

Students learn that **fractions require EQUAL parts and name them**, and they practice creating and recognizing equal partitions of shapes (2, 3, 4, 6, 8 parts).

**Critical Misconception:** Believing parts can be different sizes and still count as equal fractions (\#1)

**Success Indicator:** Student consistently creates/identifies equal partitions and rejects unequal ones

**Biggest Risk:** Accepting "close enough" instead of true equality; moving to fraction notation too quickly

---

## 1.1 LEARNING GOALS

*Verbatim — Script Must Achieve These*

**L1:** "Partition shapes into equal areas (2,3,4,6,8) and name parts; recognize that equal-size parts can be named with fractions."

**L2:** "Express each equal part as a unit fraction of the whole using fraction notation; partition into halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, eighths."

**Module Goal (Student-Facing):**  
"For our fraction work, you'll learn what makes parts equal by splitting shapes into equal parts of a whole."

**Exit Check Tests:** Can identify equal partitions AND match simple fraction names to visuals (e.g., "which shows thirds?")

### **1.1.1 Standards Cascade**

| Building On | 2.G.A.3 \- Partition circles/rectangles into equal shares (halves, quarters) |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Addressing** | **3.G.A.2** \- Partition shapes into equal areas; **3.NF.A.1** \- Understand fractions |
| **Building Toward** | **3.NF.A.2, 3.NF.A.2a** \- Understanding unit fractions and fraction notation |

### **1.1.2 Module Bridges**

**From Grade 2:**  
Students can identify and partition basic shapes (circles, rectangles, squares) into 2-4 equal parts, using informal language like "half" and "quarter"

**This Module:**  
Students learn to partition shapes into equal areas (2, 3, 4, 6, 8 parts) and recognize that equal-size parts can be named with fractions

**To Module 2:**  
This prepares students to name unit fractions (1/b) and understand fraction notation formally. Module 2 also introduces circles as a new shape for partitioning, building on the hexagon work from Module 1\.

---

## 1.2 SCOPE BOUNDARIES

### **✅ Must Teach**

* Understanding that shapes must be divided into **EQUAL parts** for fractions  
* Partitioning shapes into 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 equal parts  
* Recognizing when parts are equal vs unequal  
* Understanding "the whole" as what we're dividing  
* Unit fraction notation (1/b) introduced AFTER visual/vocabulary grounding  
* Relevant Vocabulary: whole, partition, equal parts, fraction

### **❌ Must Not Include**

* Numerator/denominator terminology (Module 2\)  
* Comparing fraction sizes (Module 10+)  
* Adding fractions (Unit 6\)  
* Equivalent fractions (Module 8\)  
* Number lines (Module 4\)  
* Circles (Module 2 — hexagons complete Module 1 shape progression)  
* Comparing parts from different-sized wholes (Same Whole Principle)

⚠️ **SAME WHOLE PRINCIPLE:** All visual comparisons must use identical shapes and sizes. Never compare fractions across different-sized wholes. If showing 1/4 and 1/2, both must be on identically-sized shapes. This prevents the misconception that fraction size is absolute rather than relative to the whole.

---

## 1.3 VOCABULARY ARCHITECTURE

**Assessment Vocabulary (appears on STAAR):**  
partition, equal parts, fraction, whole, halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, eighths

### **Vocabulary Staging by Phase**

| Phase | Terms | Introduction Approach |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Warm-Up** | equal, parts | Use naturally — "Are these pieces equal?" No formal introduction |
| **Lesson Section 1** | "whole" | First activity: "This entire shape — all of it together — is our WHOLE" |
|  | "partition" | After first partition action: "When we split something into equal pieces, we call that PARTITIONING" |
|  | halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, eighths | As students create each type: "You shaded one of two equal parts: that's one HALF" |
|  | "equal parts" | After multiple partition experiences |
| **Lesson Section 2** | "fraction" | With notation bridge: "These equal parts can be named with FRACTIONS, or numbers that show parts of a whole" |
| **Practice** | (All terms) | Use in question contexts: "Which shows fourths?" "Find the shape that's been divided into thirds" |
| **Synthesis** | (All terms) | Expect natural student use in reflection |

### **Terms to Avoid (Save for Later Modules)**

* numerator, denominator (Module 2\)  
* unit fraction (Module 2\)  
* equivalent (Module 8\)  
* greater than, less than for fractions (Module 10\)  
* improper fraction, mixed number (Module 6-7)

---

## 1.4 MISCONCEPTIONS

### **1.4.1 Unequal Parts (PRIMARY)**

**Trigger Behavior:**  
Student accepts or creates partitions where parts are visibly different sizes; suggests that "sort of equal" is acceptable for fractions

**Why It Happens:**  
Informal everyday language ("I'll split this") doesn't require precision; visual estimation without measurement Toys; lack of understanding that fractions are based on exact equality

#### Path C (VPSS) Intervention

**Visual Cue:**  
Use pattern tiles to overlay and directly compare part sizes; show grid arrays where equal parts fill identical grid units

**Prevention Strategy:**  
Start with grid rectangles where equality is built-in through counting; use pattern tiles that physically match when overlaid; emphasize visual comparison and matching throughout

---

### **1.4.2 Misidentifying the Whole**

**Trigger Behavior:**  
Student loses track of what constitutes "one whole"; compares parts from different-sized wholes; treats part as whole or whole as part

**Why It Happens:**  
No clear boundary established for "the whole"; attention shifts to parts and loses sight of complete object; comparing across different contexts without resetting "whole" reference

#### Path C (VPSS) Intervention

**Visual Cue:**  
Highlight the entire shape before partitioning; show complete grid array with boundary clearly marked; use pattern tiles that show complete hexagon or rectangle as "one whole"

**Prevention Strategy:**  
Always establish "this is our whole" before partitioning; use consistent shape sizes; keep whole shape visible even after partitioning; build vocabulary around "the whole shape"

## 1.5 Toy SPECIFICATIONS

### **1.5.1 Grid Arrays (Primary Toy)**

#### Core Specifications

| Aspect | Specification |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Fixed Size** | All grid arrays use the SAME rectangle dimensions throughout Module 1\. This reinforces "1 whole"—the whole doesn't change size, only how it's partitioned. |
| **Interaction** | Click to place partition lines (vertical or horizontal); click to shade sections |
| **Feedback** | Partition lines appear; shaded sections highlight; parts show as selected |
| **Validation** | System counts grid units per section; confirms equality when all sections have same count; tracks shaded section count |
| **Error Feedback** | Unequal parts trigger visual size mismatch highlight \+ "These parts have different sizes. Try again." |
| **Shading Purpose** | After partitioning, students immediately shade sections to show "1 of 3 equal parts" \= 1/3, etc. Maintains connection between action and fraction naming. **Never skip shading after partitioning.** |

#### Cut Limitations (Pixel Constraints)

| Dimension | Maximum Cuts | Maximum Parts | Reason |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Short side (height) | 5 cuts | 6 parts | Pixel space |
| Long side (width) | 7 cuts | 8 parts | Pixel space |

**System Controls:** Each interaction has a programmed limit on available cuts. Students cannot exceed the limit, preventing invalid configurations and reducing cognitive load.

#### Supported Configurations by Fraction

| Fraction | Supported Configurations | NOT Supported |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Halves** | 1×2 (vertical) ✓, 2×1 (horizontal) ✓ | — |
| **Thirds** | 1×3 (vertical) ✓, 3×1 (horizontal) ✓ | — |
| **Fourths** | 1×4 (vertical) ✓, 4×1 (horizontal) ✓, 2×2 ✓ | — |
| **Sixths** | 1×6 (vertical) ✓, 6×1 (horizontal) ✓, 2×3 ✓, 3×2 ✓ | — |
| **Eighths** | 1×8 (vertical) ✓, 2×4 ✓, 4×2 ✓ | 8×1 (horizontal) ✗ |

⚠️ **EIGHTHS CONSTRAINT:** Cannot support 8 horizontal strips (would require 7 cuts on short side; max is 5). Scripts must NOT demonstrate or expect 8×1 horizontal configuration.

### **1.5.2 Hexagons (Pattern Block Shape)**

| Aspect | Specification |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Available Partitions** | 2, 3, 6 divisions (natural hexagon symmetry) |
| **Interaction** | Click to place partition lines along symmetry axes; click to shade sections |
| **Validation** | Visual symmetry check; straight edges make equality verification clear; system tracks shaded section count |
| **Error Feedback** | Asymmetric partition shows mismatch \+ "These sections aren't equal. Look at the symmetry." |
| **Purpose** | Extend partitioning to multi-sided shapes while maintaining verification through straight edges |
| **Shading Purpose** | After partitioning, students shade sections to show "1 of 3 equal parts" \= 1/3, etc. Guide dialogue connects shading to fraction naming. |

### **1.5.3 Partition/Eraser Toy**

| Aspect | Specification |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Interaction** | Click/drag to draw partition lines; hover over line \+ click to erase |
| **Validation** | Lines snap to create equal divisions when close to valid partition |
| **Purpose** | Allows experimentation; reduces anxiety about mistakes |
| **CRITICAL** | Must demonstrate eraser functionality BEFORE first student partition attempt |

### **Interaction Constraints (All Toys)**

* NO verbal/spoken student responses — Guide speaks, student acts  
* NO keyboard/text input — all responses via click/tap/drag  
* NO open-ended questions requiring typed answers — use selection or action tasks  
* Questions in Guide speech must be either rhetorical (Guide answers) or answered through on-screen action

## 1.7 LESSON (10-14 minutes)

**Detail Level:** Full interaction specification (AI formats and tags)

### **Core Purpose**

Develop understanding that fractions require equal parts; learn to create equal partitions; name them with words, then with mathematical notation.

### **Pedagogical Flow**

Module 1 teaches partitioning, shading, and naming as an integrated progression. The lesson moves through three sections:

1. Grid mastery with fraction words  
2. Notation introduction  
3. Hexagon extension with full naming

This sequence preserves immediate connection (partition→shade) while building from concrete spatial work to abstract notation.

### **Lesson Structure**

| Section | Focus |
| :---- | :---- |
| Section 1 | Grid Mastery with Fraction Words |
| Section 2 | Notation Bridge |
| Section 3 | Hexagon Extension |

---

### **1.7.1 LESSON SECTION 1: Grid Mastery with Fraction Words**

**Interaction 1.1: Establishing the Whole \+ Toy Orientation**

* **Visual:** Complete undivided grid array appears  
* **Guide:** "This rectangle is our WHOLE. It's like one chocolate bar. When we divide the whole into parts, each part is a piece of THIS whole."  
* **Toy Demo:** "If you make a cut you don't like, you can hover over the line and click to erase it. Watch\!"  
* **Prompt:** Student practices eraser on pre-placed line  
* **Vocabulary:** Introduce "whole"  
* **Remediation:** Light only (Toy practice)

**Interaction 1.2: Partition into Halves**

* **Prompt:** "Click once in the middle to split the rectangle into 2 equal parts."  
* **On Correct:** "You made two parts. Let's check—are they equal?"  
* **Guide:** \[compares the parts\] “We checked the two parts are equal. That's two halves."

**Interaction 1.3: Shade One Half**

* **Visual:** Bar partitioned into halves from 1.2  
* **Guide:** "Now, please click one of those parts to shade it."  
* **Prompt:** "Click on 1 of the 2 parts to shade it."  
* **Remediation:** Full L-M-H (shade focus)  
* **On Correct:** "Yes. You selected one part out of two equal parts."  
* **Vocabulary:** After shading, introduce "partition": "When mathematicians divide something into equal parts like you just did, they call it PARTITIONING."

**Interaction 1.4: Partition into Fourths (CUT FLEXIBILITY INTRODUCTION)**

This is the key teaching moment for cut orientation. Students must see that "four equal parts" can look three different ways.

* **Visual:** Fresh undivided grid array 

  **DEMONSTRATION SEQUENCE (all three configurations, \~45 seconds):**


  **Configuration A — Vertical Rectangles:**


* **Guide:** "Here's one way to make four equal parts: three cuts going down."  
* \[Demo: Show bar divided into 4 vertical strips\]  
* **Guide:** "Four tall, narrow rectangles. Each one is the same size."  
    
  **Configuration B — Horizontal Rectangles:**  
    
* \[CLEAR the bar\]  
* **Guide:** "But watch—here's another way."  
* \[Demo: Show bar divided into 4 horizontal strips\]  
* **Guide:** "Four wide rectangles. Still four equal parts."  
    
  **Configuration C — Quadrants (2x2):**  
    
* \[CLEAR the bar\]  
* **Guide:** "And one more way."  
* \[Demo: Show bar divided into 2x2 grid—one vertical cut AND one horizontal cut\]  
* **Guide:** "One cut down, one cut across. Four grid units. Still four equal parts."  
    
  **KEY INSIGHT (REQUIRED):**  
    
* **Guide:** "Three different ways to cut, but they ALL show fourths. What matters isn't how you cut—it's that you end up with four pieces that are exactly the same size."  
    
  **STUDENT TURN:**  
    
* **Visual:** Fresh undivided grid array  
* **Guide:** "Your turn. Make four equal parts any way you want."  
* **Prompt:** "Split the bar into 4 equal parts."  
* **Remediation:**  
  * **Light:** "Check that you have four parts, all the same size."  
  * **Medium:** \[Visual showing grid units\] "Count the grid units in each part—are they equal?"  
  * **Heavy:** \[Modeling\] "Let me show you one way..." \[Demo ONE configuration, not all three\]  
* **On Correct:** "Right. Four equal parts."  
    
  **⚠️ CRITICAL:** Accept ANY of the three configurations (or valid combinations). Do NOT express preference for one over another. The learning is that multiple valid solutions exist.

**Interaction 1.5: Shade One Fourth**

* **Visual:** Bar partitioned into fourths from 1.4 (whatever configuration student created)  
* **Guide:** "Now shade just one part."  
* **Prompt:** "Click on one of the 4 parts to shade it."  
* **Remediation:** Full L-M-H (shade focus)  
* **On Correct:** "Good. One out of four equal parts."  
* **Vocabulary:** "When all parts are the same size, we call them EQUAL PARTS. That's our math word for parts that match perfectly."

**NOTATION INTRODUCTION (embedded after 1.5, before 1.6):**

* **Visual:** Keep student's shaded fourths visible; add notation 1/4 nearby  
* **Guide:** "See this symbol: 1/4? That's how we write 'one out of four equal parts.'"  
* **Guide:** "The bottom number tells us how many equal parts we made. The top number tells us how many parts we selected."  
* **Reinforcement:** "No matter HOW you cut the bar—tall rectangles, wide rectangles, or smaller rectangles—if you have four equal parts and shade one, it's always 1/4."

**Interaction 1.6: Partition into Thirds**

* **Visual:** New undivided grid array  
* **Guide:** "Can you partition this one into three equal parts?"  
* **Prompt:** "Partition the rectangle into 3 equal parts."  
* **Orientation:** Accept vertical or horizontal cuts  
* **Remediation:** Full L-M-H (focus on equal parts count, NOT cut direction)  
* **On Correct:** "Right. You partitioned the whole into three equal parts."

**Interaction 1.7: Shade One Third**

* **Visual:** Bar partitioned into thirds from 1.6  
* **Guide:** "Can you shade just one part?"  
* **Prompt:** "Click on 1 of the 3 parts to shade it."  
* **Remediation:** Full L-M-H (shade focus)  
* **On Correct:** "Right. That's one out of three equal parts. We write one of three equal parts as 1/3."  
* **Pattern callout:** "Notice the pattern? The bottom number always shows our total number of equal parts."

**Interaction 1.8: Partition into Sixths**

* **Visual:** New undivided grid array  
* **Guide:** "Let's partition this rectangle into six equal parts. This one is more advanced."  
* **Strategy (REQUIRED):** "Here's one strategy: First split the whole in half. Then split each half into three equal parts. That gives you six equal sections." \[DEMONSTRATE—but note student may use different valid approach\]  
* **Guide:** "Give it a try."  
* **Prompt:** "Partition the rectangle into six equal parts."  
* **Orientation:** Accept any cut pattern that produces 6 equal parts (vertical, horizontal, mixed, or different strategy like thirds-then-halves)  
* **Remediation:** Full L-M-H (strategy scaffold focus, not orientation correction)  
* **On Correct:** "Correct\! Six equal parts."

**Interaction 1.9: Shade One Sixth**

* **Visual:** grid array partitioned into sixths from 1.8  
* **Guide:** "Now shade just 1 part, please."  
* **Prompt:** "Shaden 1 of the 6 parts."  
* **Remediation:** Full L-M-H (shade focus)  
* **On Correct:** "Yes. One out of six equal parts. That's 1/6."

**Interaction 1.10: Partition into Eighths**

* **Visual:** New undivided grid array (same fixed rectangle)  
* **Guide:** "Let's do one more—eight equal parts this time. Remember how we made four parts? We can extend that strategy."  
* **Strategy (REQUIRED):** "First halves, then fourths, then eighths."  
* **Demonstration:** Show 2×4 configuration (2 rows, 4 columns)  
  * \[Demo: First cut \= One horizontal cut\]   
  * \[Demo: Second cut \= vertical center\]  
  * \[Demo: Two more vertical cuts\]  
* **Guide:** "Eight equal parts—two rows of four."  
* **Guide:** "Your turn."  
* **Prompt:** "Partition the rectangle into eight equal parts."  
* **System:** Cut limiter set to allow eighths configurations  
* **Orientation:** Accept 8 vertical strips, 2×4, or 4×2. (Note: 8 horizontal strips not supported by Toy)  
* **Remediation:**  
  * **Light:** "Remember the strategy—halves, then fourths, then eighths."  
  * **Medium:** \[Visual guidance\] "You need 8 equal parts. Try halving what you have."  
  * **Heavy:** \[Modeling\] "Let me show you: First halves, then fourths, then each fourth in half makes eighths."  
* **On Correct:** "Good. Eight equal parts."

  **⚠️ TECHNICAL NOTE:** The grid cannot support 8 horizontal strips (would require 7 cuts on the short side, which only allows 5). Remediation should guide toward 2×4, 4×2, or 8 vertical strips if student is stuck.

**Interaction 1.11: Shade One Eighth**

* **Visual:** Bar partitioned into eighths from 1.10  
* **Guide:** "Can you shade just one part?"  
* **Prompt:** "Click on one of the 8 parts to shade it."  
* **Remediation:** Full L-M-H (shade focus)  
* **On Correct:** "Right: 1/8. One out of eight equal parts. You're getting this\!"  
* **Notice**: 2 parts, 4 parts, 8 parts—each time we doubled the number of parts, each piece got smaller. More parts means smaller pieces.

**SECTION 1 TRANSITION TO SECTION 2  (embedded after 1.11, no prompt)**

* **Visual:** All five grid arrays appear together (1/2, 1/4, 1/3, 1/6, 1/8)  
* **Guide:** "Look at all the fractions you've made: 1/2, 1/4, 1/3, 1/6, and 1/8. Each fraction shows one part of a whole that's been partitioned into equal parts."

**→ SECTION 1 COMPLETE. PROCEED TO SECTION 2: NOTATION CONSOLIDATION.**

---

### **1.7.2 LESSON SECTION 2: Notation Bridge**

**Note:** Basic notation (1/4) was introduced embedded in Section 1 after fourths. Section 2 consolidates and extends notation understanding before shape transfer.

**Interaction 2.1: Notation Matching**

* **Visual:** Three partitioned/shaded bars (1/2, 1/3, 1/4) with notation symbols inside one unit of each grid.  
* **Guide:** "You've seen how we write fractions. Let's take what we’ve learned through writing fractions and practice matching symbols to the rectangles.   
* **Prompt:** "Match each fraction symbol to its grid array." \[Drag-and-drop or selection\]  
* **Remediation:** Full L-M-H  
* **On Correct:** "Right. The bottom number shows total parts, and the top number shows shaded parts."

**Interaction 2.2: Notation Reading**

* **Visual:** Fraction symbol shown (e.g., 1/6), multiple bars to choose from  
* **Guide:** "Which rectangle shows this fraction?"  
* **Prompt:** "Select the rectangle that shows 1/6."  
* **Remediation:** Full L-M-H  
* **On Correct:** "Yes. One out of six equal parts."

**→ SECTION 2 COMPLETE. PROCEED TO SECTION 3: HEXAGON EXTENSION.**  
---

### **1.7.3 LESSON SECTION 3: Hexagon Extension**

**(5-7 interactions, 5-6 min)**

**Purpose:** Transfer partitioning skill to new shape; demonstrate that notation works across representations.

**Critical Toy Difference:** Hexagons (and later, circles) use RADIAL cuts—lines that start from the center and go outward to the edges. This is different from bars, where cuts can go anywhere. Students need explicit instruction on this technique.

**Interaction 3.0: Radial Cutting Introduction (No Prompt—Demonstration Only)**

* **Visual:** Hexagon with center point marked  
* **Guide:** "You've been cutting rectangles with lines that go straight across. For hexagons, we have to work differently to make our parts equal."  
* **Guide:** "See this point in the center? On hexagons, our cuts start from the center and go out to the corners or vertices, like spokes on a wheel. For now, we are just going to cut to the corners. We will try from any part of the edge later as you learn more."  
* **Visual Demo:** Show a cut being drawn from center to vertex  
* **Guide:** "Follow along with me. I start at the center, and draw out to the vertex. That's how we'll partition hexagons."  
* **Visual Demo:** Show a second cut from center to opposite vertex, creating halves  
* **Guide:** "When we  make two cuts from the center that travel  to opposite vertices of the shape, we make two equal parts."

**Why This Matters:** Without explicit radial cutting instruction, students will attempt to draw horizontal/vertical lines across hexagons (like bars), which won't create equal parts. This is a Toy affordance, not a math concept—but it must be taught.

**Interaction 3.1: Partition Hexagon into Halves**

* **Visual:** Fresh hexagon with center point visible  
* **Guide:** "Your turn to try. Please draw a line from the center to one vertex, then from the center to the opposite vertex."  
* **Prompt:** "Partition the hexagon into 2 equal parts using radial cuts."  
* **Remediation:**  
  * **Light:** "Almost. Start your cut from the center point."  
  * **Medium:** \[Visual highlights center point\] "Remember: cuts start from the center of the shape and go out to the vertex."  
  * **Heavy:** \[Modeling\] "Follow along, and I’ll show you how I work it out. I click the center, then drag to the vertex. Then center again, to the opposite vertex. Two equal parts."  
* **On Correct:** "Right. Two equal parts, just like with the rectangle, but with a different cutting technique."

**Interaction 3.2: Shade One Half on Hexagon**

* **Visual:** Hexagon partitioned into halves from 3.1  
* **Guide:** "Try shading one part."  
* **Prompt:** "Click on one of the 2 parts to shade it."  
* **Remediation:** Full L-M-H (shade focus—same as bar shading)  
* **On Correct:** "Yes. One out of two equal parts—1/2.”  
* **Comparison:** (Reveal ½ Grid array \- labeled) “  Same fraction, different shape."

**Interaction 3.3: Partition Hexagon into Thirds**

* **Visual:** New hexagon with center point visible  
* **Guide:** "Now try three equal parts. You'll need three cuts from the center, spaced evenly around the hexagon."  
* **Strategy Scaffold:** "Think of it like slicing a pie into three pieces: each cut goes from the center to the vertex."  
* **Prompt:** "Partition the hexagon into 3 equal parts."  
* **Remediation:**  
  * **Light:** "Let’s check again. Remember to space your cuts evenly. Each section should be the same size."  
  * **Medium:** \[Visual shows suggested cut positions\] "Try placing cuts skipping one vertex of the hexagon."  
  * **Heavy:** \[Modeling\] "Let me show you. Center to here, center to here, center to here. Three equal sections."  
* **On Correct:** "Three equal parts."

**Interaction 3.4: Shade One Third on Hexagon**

* **Visual:** Hexagon partitioned into thirds from 3.3  
* **Guide:** "Please shade one part."  
* **Prompt:** "Click on one of the 3 parts to shade it."  
* **Remediation:** Full L-M-H  
* **On Correct:** "1/3—one out of three equal parts. The notation works the same way."

**Interaction 3.5: Partition Hexagon into Sixths**

* **Visual:** New hexagon  
* **Guide:** "One more. Can you make six equal parts?"  
* **Strategy:** "Remember how we made sixths on the rectangle? First halves, then thirds in each half."  
* **Prompt:** "Partition the hexagon into 6 equal parts."  
* **Remediation:** Full L-M-H  
* **On Correct:** "Six equal parts\!"

**Interaction 3.6: Shade One Sixth on Hexagon**

* **Visual:** Hexagon partitioned into sixths from 3.5  
* **Guide:** "Try shading one part of the whole shape."  
* **Prompt:** "Click on one of the 6 parts to shade it."  
* **Remediation:** Full L-M-H  
* **On Correct:** "1/6. You’re seeing how we partition rectangles AND hexagons into equal parts and name them with fractions."

**CROSS-SHAPE CONNECTION (embedded after final hexagon, no prompt)**

* **Visual:** Grid array showing 1/3 alongside hexagon showing 1/3  
* **Guide:** "Look: here we have different shapes, but the same fraction describes them both. 1/3 means one out of three equal parts, no matter what shape you're working with."

**→ SECTION 3 COMPLETE. LESSON COMPLETE.**

### **REQUIRED PHRASES (Must Appear in Script)**

* "This entire shape is our WHOLE"  
* "When we split one whole into equal pieces, we call that PARTITIONING"  
* "For fractions to work, all pieces must be exactly the same size"  
* "These equal parts can be named with FRACTIONS"  
* All five fraction words: "halves," "thirds," "fourths," "sixths," "eighths"

### **FORBIDDEN PHRASES (Create Misconceptions)**

* ❌ "Close enough" or "about the same" (undermines equality requirement)  
* ❌ "Numerator" or "denominator" (Module 2 vocabulary)  
* ❌ "These fractions are equal/equivalent" (equivalence is Module 8\)  
* ❌ Any reference to circles (Module 2 content)

### **CUT ORIENTATION FLEXIBILITY**

**The Fourths Moment (Interaction 1.4):** Fourths is the critical teaching moment. Demonstrate ALL THREE configurations before student attempts:

| Configuration | Cuts | Result |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Vertical rectangles | 3 vertical cuts | 4 tall, narrow pieces |
| Horizontal rectangles | 3 horizontal cuts | 4 wide, short pieces |
| Quadrants (2x2) | 1 vertical \+ 1 horizontal | 4 squares |

**Key teaching point:** "Three different ways to cut, but they ALL show fourths. What matters isn't how you cut—it's that you end up with four pieces that are exactly the same size."

**Subsequent Interactions (1.6+):** Once flexibility is established at fourths, accept any valid configuration for thirds, sixths, and eighths without re-demonstrating alternatives. The principle has been taught.

**Remediation Constraint:**

* ❌ "Try making your cuts go the other way"  
* ❌ "The squares method is easier"  
* ✅ "Check that all your parts are the same size"  
* ✅ "Count the grid squares in each part"

**Validator Note:** Partition validation checks for equal parts count, not cut pattern. All configurations that produce the target number of equal parts are correct.

### **Misconception Prevention (Both Required)**

**M1.1 (Unequal Parts):**

* Include visual verification prompts throughout Section 1  
* Include ONE interaction showing unequal parts being rejected (place between 1.7 and 1.8)

**M1.2 (Misidentifying the Whole):**

* Establish "whole" explicitly in Interaction 1.1  
* Reference "this whole" when introducing each new bar

### **Opening Frame**

* **Purpose:** Signal shift from practice to reflection/connection.  
* **Guide:** "You've learned a lot about equal parts. Let's discover how these ideas connect to even bigger patterns in math."

**Task S.1: Size Observation**

* **Purpose:** Surface the relationship between number of parts and part size through visual comparison.  
* **Visual:** Two grid arrays, same size:  
  * Array A: Partitioned into halves, 1 shaded (1/2)  
  * Array B: Partitioned into fourths, 1 shaded (1/4)  
* **Guide setup:** "Look at these two rectangles. They're the same size, but partitioned differently. Think about why it's important that both rectangles are the same size."  
* **Prompt:** "Which shaded part is bigger? Click the rectangle with the bigger shaded part."  
* **Correct Answer:** Array A (the half)  
* **On Correct:** "Yes. You spotted it."  
* **Connection (Guide states after task):** "This is a big idea in math—when we split one whole into more parts, each part gets smaller. When you have fewer parts, each part is bigger."

**Task S.2: Pattern Discovery (Equal vs Unequal)**

* **Purpose:** Apply the equal parts rule to identify what doesn't follow the rule. VPSS emphasis on visual verification.  
* **Visual:** Four shapes in grid:  
  * Grid array: halves (2 equal parts)  
  * Grid array: thirds (3 equal parts)  
  * Hexagon: thirds (3 equal parts)  
  * Grid array: 3 unequal parts  
* **Guide:** "Three of these shapes follow our rule about fractions. One breaks the rule."  
* **Prompt:** "Click the shape that breaks our pattern."  
* **Correct Answer:** The grid array with unequal parts  
* **On Correct:** "Right. That one has unequal parts. You used the rule of equal parts to solve a puzzle\!"

**Task S.3: Real-World Reasoning**

* **Purpose:** Apply size reasoning to real-world context.  
* **Visual:** Three grid arrays representing chocolate bars:  
  * Array A: Partitioned into fourths, 1 shaded  
  * Array B: Partitioned into thirds, 1 shaded  
  * Array C: Partitioned into sixths, 1 shaded  
* **Guide:** "Think about sharing things in real life. If these rectangles were chocolate bars to share with friends, which one gives each person the biggest piece?"  
* **Prompt:** "Click on the bar where each person would get the biggest piece."  
* **Correct Answer:** Array B (thirds—fewest parts means biggest pieces)  
* **On Correct:** "That's right."  
* **Connection (Guide states after task):** "You're using math to solve real problems. When we share with fewer people, each person gets a bigger part."

**Metacognitive Reflection**

* **Purpose:** Build awareness of reasoning strategies—open reflection, not multiple choice.  
* **Guide:** "Take a moment to think about how you figured that out. Did you compare the sizes of the shaded parts, or did you think about sharing with friends?"  
* **No prompt—reflective pause only.**

**Task S.4: Generalization**

* **Purpose:** Articulate the core principle that unifies all fraction work.  
* **Visual:** Four partitioned and shaded shapes:  
  * Grid array: 1/2  
  * Grid array: 1/4  
  * Hexagon: 1/3  
  * Grid array: 1/6  
* **Guide:** "Look at all these different fractions. They all follow one rule. What's the ONE thing that's always true about all of them?"  
* **Prompt:** "Click on the answer that tells what's always true about fractions."  
* **Options:**  
  * The parts must be equal  
  * There must be 4 parts  
  * One part must be bigger  
* **Correct Answer:** "The parts must be equal"  
* **On Correct:** "Yes\! Fractions are all about equal parts of a whole. That's what makes fractions work\!"

**Identity-Building Closure**

* **Purpose:** Specific, growth-oriented affirmation connecting to future learning.  
* **Guide:** "You've done amazing work\! You can recognize equal parts, create them, compare them, and even spot them in the real world. Next time, we'll use this understanding to name specific fractions and see how they relate to each other."
