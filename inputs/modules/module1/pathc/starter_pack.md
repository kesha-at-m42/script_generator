# **MODULE 1: WHAT MAKES A FRACTION?**

## **STARTER PACK \- VPSS PATH C ONLY**

 **Path:** Visual Pattern Spatial Structure (VPSS) \- Path C Only  
---

## **1.0 MODULE SNAPSHOT**

### **THE ONE THING**

Students learn that **fractions require EQUAL parts and name them**, and they practice creating and recognizing equal partitions of shapes (2, 3, 4, 6, 8 parts).

### **CRITICAL PARAMETERS**

* **Critical Misconception:** Believing parts can be different sizes and still count as equal fractions (\#1)  
* **Success Indicator:** Student consistently creates/identifies equal partitions and rejects unequal ones  
* **Biggest Risk:** Accepting "close enough" instead of true equality; moving to fraction notation too quickly

### **PATH PURPOSE \- VPSS (Path C)**

**Approach:** Visual-first using pattern tiles as primary tool for creating and understanding equal partitions

**Serves learners who:**

* Think spatially  
* Benefit from tactile manipulation  
* See whole patterns before analyzing parts

**Cognitive Strength:** Visual pattern recognition and spatial reasoning

**Unique Approach:** Creating partitions develops understanding before naming (hands-on construction)

### **CONVERGENCE COMMITMENT**

All paths must reach:

* Understanding that fractions require equal parts  
* Ability to partition shapes into 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 equal parts  
* Recognition of "the whole" as what we're dividing

---

## **1.1 SCOPE FENCE**

### **✅ JUST THIS \- What we MUST teach**

* Understanding that shapes must be divided into **EQUAL parts** for fractions  
* Partitioning shapes into 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 equal parts  
* Recognizing when parts are equal vs unequal  
* Understanding "the whole" as what we're dividing

### **❌ NOT THIS \- Boundaries we MUST respect**

* Formal fraction notation beyond showing 1/b visually (Module 2\)  
* Comparing fraction sizes (Module 10+)  
* Adding fractions (Unit 6\)  
* Equivalent fractions (Module 8\)  
* Number lines (Module 4\)

### **⚠️ THE TRAP TO AVOID**

When students see 1/4, they might want to know "what's 2/4?" **DON'T GO THERE.** We're only establishing equal parts. Also avoid explaining WHY we need equal parts beyond "that's how fractions work."

### **🎯 PEDAGOGICAL COMMITMENT (Path C \- VPSS)**

"Visual exploration through pattern tiles before symbols. Create equal parts through manipulation before naming them. Student discovery through visual patterns before teacher explanation. Every partition must be checked for equality through visual/tactile verification."

---

## **1.2 FOUNDATION**

### **1.2.1 LEARNING GOALS**

**OUR L1 (VERBATIM):**  
 "Partition shapes into equal areas (2,3,4,6,8) and name parts; recognize that equal-size parts can be named with fractions."

**OUR L2 (VERBATIM):**  
 "Express each equal part as a unit fraction of the whole using fraction notation; partition into halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, eighths."

**Integration Point:** After students successfully partition and verify equal parts, introduce notation as "the mathematical way to name what you just created." Visual first, symbols second.

**Module Goal (Student-Facing):**  
 "For our fraction work, you’ll learn what makes parts equal by splitting shapes into equal parts of a whole.You'll learn how to split shapes into equal parts and understand what makes parts equal for fractions."

**Exit Check Tests:** Can identify equal partitions AND match simple fraction names to visuals (e.g., "which shows thirds?")

### **1.2.2 STANDARDS CASCADE**

| Building On | 2.G.A.3 \- Partition circles/rectangles into equal shares (halves, quarters) |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Addressing** | **3.G.A.2** \- Partition shapes into equal areas; **3.NF.A.1** \- Understand fractions |
| **Building Toward** | **3.NF.A.2, 3.NF.A.2a** \- Understanding unit fractions and fraction notation |

### **1.2.3 MODULE BRIDGES**

**From Grade 2:**  
 Students can identify and partition basic shapes (circles, rectangles, squares) into 2-4 equal parts, using informal language like "half" and "quarter"

**This Module:**  
 Students learn to partition shapes into equal areas (2, 3, 4, 6, 8 parts) and recognize that equal-size parts can be named with fractions

**To Module 2:**  
This prepares students to name unit fractions (1/b) and understand fraction notation formally. Module 2 also introduces circles as a new shape for partitioning, building on the hexagon work from Module 1\.

### **CONTINUITY LANGUAGE (Path C \- VPSS)**

**Callback to Grade 2:**  
 "Previously in school, you’ve seen shapes divided into parts. Remember in Grade 2 when you saw shapes divided into parts? You might have noticed patterns in how shapes could be split."

**Setup for Module 2:**  
 "Now that you understand equal parts of a wholeand wholes, you're ready to name those parts. In math, we call parts of a whole “fractions.”specific parts with special numbers called fractions. Together, we’ll exploreYou'll discover how to identify just 'one part' using your visual pattern skills."

## **1.3 MISCONCEPTIONS TO ADDRESS**

**Note:** Student errors are universal. Interventions below are Path C guidance only. For complete remediation specifications and formatting requirements, see Remediation Addition Protocol document.

### **1.3.1 MISCONCEPTION M1.1: Unequal Parts**

**Trigger Behavior:**  
 Student accepts or creates partitions where parts are visibly different sizes; suggests that "sort of equal" is acceptable for fractions

**Why It Happens:**  
 Informal everyday language ("I'll split this") doesn't require precision; visual estimation without measurement tools; lack of understanding that fractions are based on exact equality

#### **PATH C (VPSS) INTERVENTION**

**Visual Cue:**  
 Use pattern tiles to overlay and directly compare part sizes; show grid arrays where equal parts fill identical grid units

**Prevention Strategy:**  
 Start with grid rectangles where equality is built-in; use pattern tiles that physically match when overlaid; emphasize visual comparison and matching

---

### **1.3.2 MISCONCEPTION M1.2: Misidentifying the Whole**

**Source:** From OUR extraction \- Misconception \#2

**Trigger Behavior:**  
 Student loses track of what constitutes "one whole"; compares parts from different-sized wholes; treats part as whole or whole as part

**Why It Happens:**  
 No clear boundary established for "the whole"; attention shifts to parts and loses sight of complete object; comparing across different contexts without resetting "whole" reference

#### **PATH C (VPSS) INTERVENTION**

**Visual Cue:**  
 Highlight the entire shape before partitioning; show complete grid array with boundary clearly marked; use pattern tiles that show complete hexagon or rectangle as "one whole"

**Prevention Strategy:**  
 Always establish "this is our whole" before partitioning; use consistent shape sizes; keep whole shape visible even after partitioning; build vocabulary around "the whole shape"

---

## **1.4 VOCABULARY & CONTENT SPECIFICATIONS**

### **1.4.1 VOCABULARY ARCHITECTURE**

**Assessment Vocabulary (appears on STAAR):**  
 partition, equal parts, fraction, whole, halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, eighths

#### **Vocabulary Sequence by Phase**

| Phase | Terms | Introduction Script |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Warm-Up** | equal, parts | Use naturally \- "Are these pieces equal?" No formal intro yet |
| **Lesson** | "partition" | After visual folding/creating, say: \[Vocabulary\_Staging\] "When we split something into equal pieces, we call that PARTITIONING" |
|  | "whole" | During first activity: "This entire shape \- all of it together \- is our WHOLE. That's what we're dividing." |
|  | "fraction" | After multiple examples of equal parts: "These equal parts can be named with FRACTIONS \- the word we use for equal parts out of one whole.special numbers" |
| **Practice** | halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, eighths | Use in question contexts naturally: "Which shows fourths?" "Find the one divided into thirds" |
| **Synthesis** | equal parts, fraction | Expect student use: "You learned that fractions name equal parts" |

**Avoid These Terms (save for later modules):**

* numerator, denominator (Module 2 introduces these formally)  
* Unit fraction (Module 2\)  
* equivalent (Module 8\)  
* greater than, less than for fractions (Module 10\)  
* improper fraction, mixed number (Module 6-7)

### **1.4.2 CONTENT PROGRESSION**

#### **UNIVERSAL EXAMPLES (Required)**

**Start:** Grid rectangles (built-in equality through counting)

**Extend:** Hexagons (straight edges, visible angles)

**Save for Later:** Circles (radial partitioning requires stronger foundation)

**PATH C (VPSS) VERSION**

**Numbers:** 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 parts (all five types required)

**Context:**  
 Pattern tiles showing various equal divisions; grid arrays; circles partitioned from center

**Shape Sequence (pedagogical progression):**

**Grid Rectangles** (Start \- Lesson beginning)

* Why first: Equality built-in through counting grid units  
* Partitions: All types (2,3,4,6,8)  
* Purpose: Foundation for visual verification  
* Cognitive advantage: Grid structure makes "equal" mathematically provable

**Hexagons** (End of Lesson \- after rectangle mastery)

* Why second: Straight edges maintain clarity; natural symmetry  
* Partitions: 2, 3, 6 (natural divisions of hexagon structure)  
* Purpose: Extend to multi-sided shapes while preserving verification ease  
* Key transition: Angles and edges provide structure; students can still verify equality through visual comparison  
* Module 1 focus: Substantial work with hexagons to build familiarity before curves

**Circles** (Module 2 \- after hexagon familiarity established)

* Why Module 2: Radial partitioning most challenging; requires solid foundation in straight-edge shapes  
* Partitions: 2, 4, 8 only (simplest radial divisions)  
* Purpose: Show equal parts work in curved shapes; extend partitioning to all shape types  
* Pedagogical decision: Separating hexagons (Module 1\) and circles (Module 2\) gives students time to internalize multi-sided partitioning before tackling curves

**Pedagogical Rationale:** Rectangle (grid-supported) → Hexagon (straight edges, angles) → Circle (curves). This progression increases spatial complexity systematically. Module 1 establishes grid and straight-edge partitioning; Module 2 extends to curves.

#### **SHAPE USAGE RULES FOR PATH C**

* **Modules 1-2:** Basic shapes (rectangles, hexagons, circles)  
* **Same Whole Principle:** Comparisons only between identical shapes/sizes  
* **Circle Conventions:** Always partition from center point  
* **Pattern Block Introduction:** Module 3 (not yet)

#### **PRESERVE FROM OUR (Universal)**

* Must include all five fraction types: halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, eighths  
* Must create partitions, not just identify them  
* Must check for equality explicitly

#### **AVOID (Universal)**

* Real-world contexts that introduce measurement complexity  
* Partitions into 5, 7, 9, 10+ parts (beyond grade level scope)  
* Comparing fraction sizes or values

## **1.5 DIGITAL SPECIFICATIONS \- PATH C (VPSS)**

### **PEDAGOGICAL PHILOSOPHY**

**Approach:** Visual-first using pattern tiles and grid arrays; students CREATE partitions through manipulation

**Visual Priority:** Show complete "whole" first, then partition it; emphasize equal-sized parts through overlay/comparison

**Cognitive Focus:** Spatial reasoning; pattern recognition; visual verification of equality

### **PRIMARY TOOLS**

#### **Grid Arrays**

* **Interaction:** Click to partition array into units  \[2\]\[3\]\[4\]\[6\]\[8\]; click/drag to partition; click to shade units.  
* **Feedback:** Clear partitions appear, Shaded parts highlight; visual cue shows selected vs. unselected parts  
* **Validation:** System checks if all parts cover equal number of grid units/cells; tracks shaded count  
* **Error State:** Unequal parts show size mismatch; prompt to try again; system counts number of total or shaded parts  
* **Shading Purpose**: After partitioning, students shade parts to reinforce "1 of 2 equal parts" \= 1/2, "2 of 3 equal parts" \= 2/3, etc.  
* **Purpose:** Builds understanding that equal parts have equal areas; provides built-in verification tool

**Pattern Tiles (Visual Recognition)**

* **Interaction:** Tap/click to select pre-arranged patterns that show equal parts  
* **Feedback:** Selected pattern highlights  
* **Validation:** Visual symmetry and repeating units indicate equality  
* **Error State:** Incorrect selection prompts visual comparison prompt  
* **Purpose:** Visual pattern recognition of equality through symmetry and matching shapes  
* **Note:** These are pre-arranged visual patterns for identification, NOT individual tiles students drag around

#### **Hexagons (Pattern Block Shape)**

* **Interaction:** Click to partition lines to divide hexagon into equal parts (2, 3, 6 divisions for Module 1). click to shade units.  
* **Feedback:**  Partition lines appear; shaded sections highlight; parts show as selected  
* **Validation:** Visual symmetry; straight edges make equality verification clear; system tracks shaded section count  
* **Error State:** Unequal parts show size mismatch; prompt to adjust; system counts number of total or shaded parts  
* **Shading Purpose**: After partitioning, students shade sections to show "1 of 3 equal parts" \= 1/3, etc.  
* **Purpose:** Extend partitioning to multi-sided shapes while maintaining straight edges for verification; shading reinforces fraction naming  
* **Pedagogical Note:** Hexagons complete Module 1 shape progression; substantial practice builds foundation for circles in Module 2

#### **Partition Drawing Tool**

* **Interaction:** Click/drag to draw partition lines on shapes  
* **Feedback:** Line snaps to create equal divisions; parts highlight when equal  
* **Validation:** System measures areas and confirms equality

## **1.6 PRACTICE ARCHITECTURE**

**Note on Practice Pool Generation:** Practice problems will be generated through a separate pipeline. The specifications below show question types, distribution, and Path C interaction patterns for Module 1\. Individual problem labeling (tiers, cognitive verbs, components) happens during practice pool generation, not in this Starter Pack.

### **1.6.1 DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS**

* **Required Mix:** 40% RECOGNITION | 40% CREATION | 20% APPLICATION

### **1.6.2 QUESTION SPECIFICATIONS \- PATH C (VPSS)**

#### **RECOGNITION QUESTIONS (4 questions \- 40%)**

**Purpose:** Identify equal vs unequal partitions; recognize "the whole"

**Question Style:** "Which shows equal parts?" with visual grid/pattern options

**Examples:**

1. "Select the rectangle that’s been divided into equal fourths" \[3 grid options shown\]  
2. "Which circle shows equal parts?" \[Pre-divided circle options\]  
3. "Find the shape where all parts match" \[Pattern tile arrangements\]  
4. "Which shows the whole divided equally?" \[Mixed shapes\]

**Success Indicator:** Student consistently selects equal partitions; rejects unequal with confidence

**Cognitive Load:** Visual comparison only; no creation required yet

---

#### **CREATION QUESTIONS (4 questions \- 40%)**

**Purpose:** Build equal partitions using tools; demonstrate understanding through action

**Question Style:** "Partition this shape into \[\#\] equal parts"

**Examples:**

1. "Use the drawing tool to divide this rectangle into 2 equal parts"  
2. "Create 4 equal parts in this grid rectangle" \[Grid array provided\]  
3. "Partition this circle into 8 equal pieces" \[Radial partitioning\]  
4. "Make 6 equal parts using pattern tiles" \[Tile manipulation\]

**Success Indicator:** Created partitions pass equality verification; student checks own work

**Cognitive Load:** Requires planning and execution; visual verification after creation

---

#### **APPLICATION QUESTIONS (2 questions \- 20%)**

**Purpose:** Apply understanding to novel contexts; demonstrate flexible thinking

**Question Style:** "Fix this partition" or "Explain why this doesn't work"

**Examples:**

1. "This shape has parts that aren't equal. How can you tell?" \[Visual analysis\]

**Success Indicator:** Can identify and correct inequality

**Cognitive Load:** Higher \- requires evaluation and problem-solving

**Novel Element:** Given imperfect work to analyze/fix rather than create from scratch

---

## **1.7 PATH PHILOSOPHY & LEARNER PROFILE**

### **PATH C: Visual Pattern Spatial Structure (VPSS)**

#### **PEDAGOGICAL FOUNDATION**

* **Research Base:** Spatial reasoning research; visual learning theory; constructivist approach through manipulation  
* **Core Principle:** Visual patterns reveal mathematical structure; students discover through creating and comparing  
* **UNIQUE PROGRESSION:** Rectangle (grid-based) → Hexagon (straight edges) → Circle (curves). This sequence leverages increasing spatial complexity while maintaining verification methods  
* **Cognitive Pathway:** See whole patterns → Manipulate to create parts → Verify equality visually → Generalize understanding

#### **UNIQUE STRENGTHS OF THIS PATH**

1. Pattern tiles and grids make equality concrete and verifiable (overlay to check)  
2. Spatial reasoning leveraged as cognitive strength rather than working around it  
3. Visual verification provides immediate feedback without relying on teacher judgment  
4. Creates foundation for array-based thinking that supports future multiplication/division connections

#### **RISKS TO AVOID**

1. Over-reliance on grid scaffolding without building toward independence (address in Modules 4-7)  
2. Pattern recognition without understanding why patterns work  
3. Visual comparison without connecting to numerical/symbolic meaning  
4. Skipping the "create" phase and only showing pre-made partitions

### **CONVERGENCE PHILOSOPHY**

#### **ALL PATHS MUST DEVELOP**

* Understanding that fractions require exactly equal parts (not approximately equal)  
* Ability to partition shapes into 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 equal parts  
* Recognition of "the whole" as complete shape before partitioning  
* Foundation for Module 2's unit fraction naming

#### **ACCEPTABLE PATH DIFFERENCES**

* Visual tools used (Path C uses grids/tiles vs other paths' tools)  
* Order of partition introduction (Path C: 2→4→8, then 3→6 based on visual patterns)  
* Language emphasis (Path C emphasizes "pattern" and "visual matching" more than other paths)

#### **NON-NEGOTIABLE SIMILARITIES**

* Mastery of core vocabulary: partition, whole, equal parts, fraction  
* Success on universal exit check (can identify equal partitions)  
* Readiness for Module 2 (prepared to name unit fractions)  
* Rejection of "close enough" \- precision required for equality

## **1.8 PHASE-SPECIFIC SCRIPT GUIDANCE \- PATH C (VPSS)**

**FOR CLAUDE:** This is your primary section for script generation. Everything you need for Path C is consolidated here.

**CRITICAL PACING PRINCIPLE:** All timing estimates guide script structure and relative emphasis, not rigid requirements. Good teaching always wins over hitting exact minutes. If students need more time to process, take it. If they're ready to move faster, do. The pedagogical flow and student understanding matter more than the clock.

### **PATH VOICE & APPROACH**

| Element | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Core Method** | Visual-first pattern discovery using grid arrays and pattern tiles |
| **Voice Calibration** | "Look with me at how these patterns show..." "See how the tiles..." "The grid reveals..." |
| **Visual Commitment** | Always show whole before partitioning; emphasize visual verification through overlay/comparison |
| **Unique Strength** | Concrete visual proof of equality through matching grid units or overlaying tiles |
| **Risk to Manage** | Building too much dependence on grid scaffold (will address in Modules 4-7) |

---

### **🔥 WARM-UP** 

**CORE PURPOSE:**  
 Activate pattern recognition for equal parts; create engagement with visual exploration

**STRUCTURE:**

* **Hook:** "Let’s lookook at these tile arrangements \- which shows equal groups?" \[Show pre-arranged options\]  
* **Discovery:** Students identify patterns of equality through visual comparison  
* **Bridge:** "Can you make 2 equal parts using these rectangles?"

#### **INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS**

* **Vocabulary:** Use "equal" and "parts" naturally \- callback only, no formal introduction  
* **Continuity:** Light callback if relevant: "Remember seeing shapes divided into parts?"  
* **Misconception Watch:** M1.1 may trigger if student accepts unequal "close enough"  
* **Digital Tool:** \[Tool\_Intro\] Grid rectangles (familiar start) \- first exposure  
* **Visual:** Pre-divided grid rectangles; pattern tile arrangements

#### **SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS ✅ Must Include**

* **Say:** "Look at these patterns \- what do they show?"  
* **Say:** "Which rectangle is divided equally?"  
* **Show:** Grid rectangles with 2-4 divisions (some equal, some unequal)  
* **Do:** Student clicks/selects equal partition  
* **Check:** "How can you tell those parts are equal?" (visual verification)

#### **SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS ❌ Never Allow**

* Don't use formal vocabulary yet (no "partition," "fraction")  
* Don't exceed 3 minutes  
* Don't introduce fraction notation  
* Don't say: "These are called fractions" or other premature naming

#### **TONE & PACING**

* **Tone:** Curious, exploratory; "Let's explorediscover..." "What do you notice?"  
* **Pacing:** Allow 10-15 seconds for visual scanning; pause after questions  
* **Energy:** Calm but engaged; emphasis on visual discovery

---

### **📚 LESSON**

#### **CORE PURPOSE:**  Develop understanding that fractions require equal parts; learn to create equal partitions; name them with words, then with mathematical notation

#### **PEDAGOGICAL FLOW:** Module 1 teaches partitioning, shading, and naming as an integrated progression. The lesson moves through three sections: (1) Grid mastery with fraction words, (2) Notation introduction, (3) Hexagon extension with full naming. This sequence preserves immediate connection (partition→shade) while building from concrete spatial work to abstract notation, leveraging VPSS spatial reasoning strengths.

#### **KEY PEDAGOGICAL PRINCIPLE:** Students partition and shade IMMEDIATELY throughout, but naming progresses: fraction words first (Section 1), then notation (Section 2+). This maintains engagement and immediate feedback while allowing spatial pattern mastery before introducing symbols. Shading reinforces "X of Y equal parts" from the start, creating concrete understanding that notation later names.

#### 

#### 

#### **TEACHING SEQUENCE**

 **1: GRID MASTERY WITH FRACTION WORDS (No Notation Yet)**

**CRITICAL MOMENT 1: Introducing "The Whole"**

| Element | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| **What Happens** | Establish complete shape as "one whole" before any partitioning; students identify whole shapes |
| **Key Visual** | Complete grid rectangle with clear boundary;  |
| **Guide Questions** | "What's the complete shape?" "Before we divide it, this whole thing is...what?" |
| **Vocabulary** | Introduce "whole" using script: "This entire shape \- all of it together \- is our WHOLE" |
| **Check** | "Click the whole shape" (verification) |
| **Misconception Prevention** | Establish clear boundary before partitioning prevents M1.2 (misidentified whole) |
| **Tool** | Grid rectangles (entry point for VPSS) |
| **Why This Tool** | Visual patterns and repeating grid structures most intuitive for spatial thinkers; "these shapes match" builds toward formal equality |

---

**CORE DEVELOPMENT** (This is the heart of the lesson \- give it time)

**CRITICAL MOMENT 2: Creating and Naming with Words (Halves, Fourths)**

| Element | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Tool Orientation (Before Student Creates)** | **Guide demonstrates partition and eraser functionality:** "Before you try, let me show you a helpful toolsomething helpful. If you make a cut you don't like..." \[Guide places partition line\] "...you can hover over the line and click to erase it. Watch\!" \[Guide erases line\] **Student practices:** "Now you try \- hover over that line and click to erase it." \[Student erases a pre-placed line\] **Why now:** Students need to know they can fix mistakes before attempting their first partition. Reduces anxiety and encourages experimentation. |
| **What Happens** | Students partition rectangles into 2 then 4 equal parts using grid arrays; immediately shade one part after each partition; use WORDS to name (no notation yet) |
| **Builds From** | Whole concept just established |
| **New Element** | Creating equal parts \+ selecting parts through shading \+ naming with fraction words |
| **Sequence for Each Fraction:** | Partition: "Click to make two equal parts" (1x2 grid) Shade: "Shade one part" (immediate after partition) Name: "You shaded one of two equal parts \- that's one HALF" Verify: "Count grid units- are they equal?" |
| **Example Progression:** | Halves (1x2 grid): Partition → Shade 1 → "That's one half" → Check equality Fourths (1x4 AND 2x2 grid): Partition → Shade 1 → "That's one fourth" → Check equality |
| **Vocabulary Staging** | After creating halves/fourths: "When we split something into equal pieces, we call that PARTITIONING" After fourths: "When all parts are the same size, we call them EQUAL PARTS"  |
| **Language Emphasis** | Use fraction words naturally throughout ("halves," "fourths") \- students hear mathematical language before seeing symbols |
| **Check** | "How many equal parts did you make?" "Which part is shaded?" "What do we call that?" |
| **Misconception Prevention** | Grid verification prevents M1.1 (unequal parts accepted) |
| **Tool** | Grid arrays (1D and 2D options) |
| **Why This Tool** | Countable units make equality provable; shading provides immediate visual feedback; grid structure supports both linear (1x4) and area-based (2x2) thinking |

---

**CRITICAL MOMENT 3: Pattern Extension (Thirds, Sixths, Eighths) \- Still Words Only**

| Element | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| **What Happens** | Extend to 3, 6, 8 equal parts; discover doubling pattern (2→4→8, 3→6); continue partition → shade → name with WORDS pattern |
| **Builds From** | Success with halves/fourths AND understanding of sequence New Element: More complex partitions; 2D grids for sixths (area-based thinking) Sequence Maintained: For EACH new fraction type, students partition → shade immediately → name with word |
| **New Element** | More complex partitions; pattern recognition across partition types |
| **Example** | Thirds (1x3 grid): Partition: "Try makingMake three equal parts" Shade: "Please shadeShade one part" Name: "That's one THIRD" Pattern Prompt: "You've made halves, fourths, thirds \- do you notice a pattern in how these parts are named what pattern do you notice in the words?" Sixths (2x3 OR 3x2 grid \- AREA-BASED): Strategy: "First split in half, then split each half into three" (explicit demonstration) Partition: Student creates 2x3 array Shade: "Please shadeShade one part" Name: "That's one SIXTH" Check: "Let’s countCount all the grid units \- six equal parts" VPSS Advantage: 2D grid shows sixths as spatial arrangement (2 rows × 3 columns), not just linear division Eighths (2x4 OR 4x2 grid): Strategy: "Start with halves, then fourths, then eighths" (repeated halving shown) Partition: Student creates 2x4 array Shade: "Can you shadeShade one part?" Name: "That's one EIGHTH" Pattern Recognition: "What happens when we double the number of  parts? The pieces get smaller. |
| **Vocabulary** | Introduce "equal parts" formally after multiple experiences |
| **Language Pattern Discovery** | "Let’s look atListen to the words \- halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, eighths \- they describe how many parts" |
| **Check** | "How many equal parts total?" "What do we call one of those parts?" Important: NO notation symbols yet \- building spatial mastery and fraction vocabulary |
| **Tool** | Grid arrays (emphasize 2D arrangements for sixths and eighths) |
| **Why This Tool** | 2D grids distinguish VPSS from Singapore's linear approach; students think about arranging equal regions in space, not just dividing length Why Words First: Students recognize and use mathematical language before abstract symbols; auditory pattern recognition ("thirds," "fourths") builds understanding that notation will later represent |
| **End of Section 1** | Students can partition grids (1D and 2D), shade to show "one part," and name using fraction words. They've experienced all 5 fraction types with immediate partition→shade→name connection. Ready for notation introduction. |

---

**CRITICAL MOMENT 4: Mathematical Notation Bridge**

| Element | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| **What Happens** | After solid experience with fraction words across all types, introduce notation as the written form of what they've been saying |
| **Builds From** | Fluency with partition → shade → name using words |
| **New Element** | Mathematical symbols (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6, 1/8) |
| **Key Bridge** | "You've been saying 'one- fourth' \- mathematicians can write ‘one-fourth’ using numbersmathematicians have a special way to WRITE that" |
| **Notation Introduction Sequence:** | Show Example: Display a partitioned, shaded grid with fourths Connect Language: "We've been saying 'one fourth'" Reveal Symbol: "We write it like this: 1/4" Explain Structure: "The bottom number tells us how many equal parts we made. The top number tells us how many parts we selected." Demonstrate: Point to shaded grid \- "See? We made 4 equal parts, and shaded 1\. That's 1/4." |
| **Vocabulary** | Introduce "fractions": \[Vocabulary\_Staging\] "These equal parts can be named with FRACTIONS \- special numbers that show parts of a whole" |
| **Application (2-3 examples on grids):** | Example 1: Show partitioned thirds with one shaded → "We've been calling this 'one- third' \- now we write 1/3" Example 2: "Please pPartition a grid into sixths and, shade one part" → Student partitions and shades → Guide: "What fraction is shaded?" → "1/6" Example 3: Show multiple grids (halves, fourths, eighths) → "Match the notation: which shows 1/2? which shows 1/8?" |
| **Notation Explanation Emphasis** | Bottom number \= denominator \= how many equal parts in the whole Top number \= numerator \= how many parts we're talking about (shaded) Connection: "You already KNOW these fractions \- now you know how to WRITE them" |
| **Check** | "Which number tells us the total parts?" "Which number shows what's shaded?" "What fraction is this?" |
| **Important** | Students RECOGNIZE notation matched to visuals they created; focus on reading and matching, not independent writing yet |
| **Tool** | Grid arrays (same tool, new layer of abstraction) |
| **Why Introduce Here** | Students have spatial mastery \+ vocabulary; notation names what they deeply understand; introducing on familiar tool (grids) keeps cognitive load manageable |
| **End of Section 2** | Students understand notation structure, can match symbols to partitioned/shaded grids, and recognize that notation represents the words they've been using |

**Section 3: HEXAGON EXTENSION (Apply Full Skill)**

**CRITICAL MOMENT 5: Shape Transfer with Complete Naming**

| Element | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| **What Happens** |  Extend equal partitioning to hexagons; students now apply full partition → shade → name with NOTATION sequence to new shape |
| **Builds From** | Notation understanding from Section 2 |
| **New Element** | Multi-sided shape with 6 sides; symmetrical structure with angles; complete naming skill applied |
| **Transfer Challenge** | "You've worked withmastered grids. Can you show equal parts on a hexagondo this on a hexagon?" |
| **Shape Introduction** | Show complete hexagon: "This is our whole \- a hexagon with 6 sides" Key Difference: "Instead of counting grid units, we'll look at sections with straight edges" Verification Method: "Count sides in each section to check equality" |
| **Partitions Covered** | Halves, thirds, sixths (2, 3, 6\) \- natural divisions of hexagon |
| **Sequence for Each (Full Skill)** | Partition: "Can you make Make \[X\] equal parts on this hexagon?" Shade: "Please shadeShade one part" Name WITH notation: "What fraction is shaded?" → "1/3" Verify: "When we count the sides, Count the sides \- are the sections equal?" |
| **Example Progression** | Halves on hexagon: Partition → Shade → "That's 1/2" (TRANSFER from grid understanding) Thirds on hexagon: Partition → Shade → "That's 1/3" Sixths on hexagon: Partition → Shade → "That's 1/6" |
| **Cross-Tool Comparison** | "After hexagon mastery, show side-by-side: Grid with fourths (2x2 shaded) showing 1/4 | Hexagon with thirds (1 section shaded) showing 1/3 Guide: "Different shapes, different partitions, but the same notation system works for both" Check: "What stayed the same? The notation shows equal parts on any shape" |
| **Pedagogical Advantage** | Straight edges and visible angles make equality verifiable without grid Symmetry provides visual proof Students see that notation transcends specific tools Prepares for circles in Module 2 (curves are next complexity level) |
| **Module 1 Focus** | Multiple hexagon partitioning experiences; build familiarity and confidence with angled shapes |
| **Important Note** | Circles come in Module 2 \- "Hexagons have straight edges you can count. After more practice, you'll be ready for circles which have curves instead |
| **Purpose** | Complete Module 1 shape progression from grid-supported (rectangles) to straight-edge multi-sided (hexagons); demonstrate that equal parts work across shapes; apply notation in new context |
| **Tool** | Hexagons with partition drawing tool |
| **Why This Tool** | After grid mastery \+ notation understanding, students ready for shape variation. Hexagons' straight edges are easier than curves while still increasing spatial complexity. Maintains verification methods (count sides/sections) while showing transferability. |
| **Why After Notation** | Students arrive with full skill set (partition, shade, name), making transfer explicit rather than learning everything simultaneously |
| **End of Section 3** | Students can partition, shade, and name with notation on BOTH grids and hexagons; understand that notation works across shapes |

**SYNTHESIS MOMENT: Connecting the Learning**

| Element | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| **What Happens** | Brief review connecting grids and hexagons; prepare for independent work |
| **Visual Summary** | Show 2-3 examples of fractions on both tools |
| **Key Message** | ""You learned to partition grids AND hexagons into equal parts, shade them, and name them with fractions. You're ready to practice on your own." |

#### **INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS**

* **Vocabulary:** whole (Section 1), partition (Section 1), equal parts (Section 1), fractions (Section 2), all fraction words throughout  
* **Examples:** 2, 4, 8 parts (doubling pattern); 3, 6 parts (doubling pattern); all five types covered  
* **Misconception Prevention:** Constant visual verification (grid counting in Section 1-2, symmetry checking in Section 3); immediate shading reinforces "X of Y parts" throughout  
* **Digital Tools:** Grid arrays (1D and 2D) Sections 1-2, notation introduced on grids Section 2, hexagons Section 3,  
* **Shape Emphasis:** Grids (all 5 fractions) → Notation bridge → Hexagons (3 fractions with notation) → Mixed application

#### **SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS ✅ Must Include**

* **Say:** "This entire shape is our WHOLE"  
* **Say:** "When we split something into equal pieces, we call that PARTITIONING"  
* **Say:** "These equal parts can be named with FRACTIONS"  
* **Show:** Grid arrays for all five partition types (2, 3, 4, 6, 8\) in Section 1  
* **Show:** 2D grids (2x3 for sixths, 2x4 for eighths) to emphasize area-based thinking  
* **Show:** Notation introduction (1/4) with explanation of top/bottom numbers in Section 2  
* **Show:** Hexagons with 2, 3, 6 partitions in Section 3  
* **Do:** Student partitions → shades immediately → names (first with words, then notation)  
* **Do:** Student matches notation to visuals (recognition practice)  
* **Check:** Frequent equality verification \- "Count the grid units" or "Look at the symmetry"  
* **Connect:** "You've been saying 'one- fourth' \- now you know how to write it: 1/4"  
* Must use words: "halves", "thirds", "fourths", "sixths", "eighths"

#### **SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS ❌ Never Allow**

* Don't introduce numerator/denominator terminology (Module 2\)  
* Don't skip immediate shading after partitioning (breaks connection)  
* Don't introduce notation before Section 2 (spatial/language foundation first)  
* Don't accept "close enough" \- precision required  
* Don't compare fraction sizes (Module 10+)  
* Don't introduce circles (Module 2 content)  
* Don't make students partition without shading (loses immediate feedback)

#### **TONE & PACING**

* **Section 1 Tone:** Discovery-focused, building vocabulary; "Let's make equal parts" "What do we call this?"  
* **Section 2 Tone:** Bridge-building, revealing; "You already know this \- here's how we write it"  
* **Section 3 Tone:** Transfer and application; "Can you do this on a new shape?"  
* **Pacing:** Processing pause after each new partition type (15-20 seconds); allow visual analysis time  
* **Emphasis:**  
  * Section 1: Visual patterns; equality verification; spatial relationships; fraction words  
  * Section 2: Symbol-visual connection; notation structure  
  * Section 3: Transferability; notation works across shapes  
* **Wait Time:** After asking "Are these equal?" \- give 10-15 seconds for visual analysis  
* **Wait Time:** After "What fraction is this?" \- give 10-15 seconds to match notation  
* **Hexagon Emphasis:** Substantial time for hexagon work \- this is new spatial complexity

#### **PEDAGOGICAL RATIONALE FOR THIS SEQUENCE**

**Why Grids First (Section 1):**

* Grid counting provides mathematical proof of equality (not visual estimation)  
* 1D AND 2D options distinguish VPSS from Singapore's linear-only approach  
* Students build spatial mastery across all 5 fraction types on familiar tool  
* Immediate partition→shade connection maintained throughout

**Why Words Before Notation (Section 1):**

* Auditory pattern recognition ("halves," "thirds," "fourths") builds linguistic foundation  
* Students hear and use mathematical language before abstract symbols  
* Reduces cognitive load \- one new layer at a time  
* Notation later "names what they know" rather than introducing everything simultaneously

**Why Notation on Grids (Section 2):**

* Introduces symbols on familiar tool (grids already mastered)  
* Students can focus on notation structure without wrestling with new visual format  
* Grid counting reinforces top/bottom number meaning (parts shaded / total parts)

**Why Hexagons After Notation (Section 3):**

* Students arrive with complete skill (partition \+ shade \+ name with notation)  
* Transfer becomes explicit: "Use your fraction skills on this new shape"  
* Straight edges easier than curves; maintains verification methods  
* Prepares for circles in Module 2

**Why 2D Grids Matter:**

* Distinguishes VPSS area-based thinking from Singapore's linear approach  
* Sixths as 2x3 array \= spatial arrangement, not just division  
* Leverages VPSS cognitive strength (pattern recognition in 2D space)  
* Prepares for future array work in multiplication

**Why Immediate Shading Throughout:**

* Maintains engagement (no extended partitioning without payoff)  
* Reinforces "X of Y equal parts" concept from start  
* Provides immediate visual feedback  
* Connects action to outcome (shade → see the relationship)
