# **MODULE 1 PATH C (VPSS)**

### **LEARNING GOAL(S):**

* Partition shapes into equal areas (2,3,4,6,8) and name parts; recognize that equal-size parts can be named with fractions.  
* Express each equal part as a unit fraction of the whole using fraction notation; partition into halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, eighths.

### **CORE CONCEPTS:** 

* Equal Parts   
* Defining the Whole

### **STANDARDS:** 

**Building On:** 2.G.A.3   
**Addressing:** 3.G.A.2, 3.NF.A.1   
**Building Toward:** 3.NF.A.2, 3.NF.A.2a

### **VOCABULARY STAGING:**

* Introduce partition, whole, equal parts during folding  
* Introduce fraction; show '1/...' notation only after parts are named

### **MISCONCEPTIONS:** 

\#1 \- Unequal Parts: Believing parts can be different sizes and still count as equal fractions   
\#2 \- Misidentifying the Whole: Losing track of what the '1' is; comparing parts of different wholes

\[Processing\_Pause \- 3 seconds\]

## **INTERACTION 1: Grid Recognition**

\[Option to add transition/framing: Let’s start by looking at how shapes can be split into the same size using grids.\]

🔵 **Visual:** \[CLEAR\] \[Visual\_Spec\_Compliant\] Two grids appear side by side:

* Left: 2x3 grid (6 squares total)  
* Right: 1x4 grid (4 squares total)

⚫ **Guide:** \[Tool\_Intro\] "Look at these grids. Each one is divided into squares. How many equal parts does the first grid have?"

🔵 **Visual:** \[CLEAR\] \[Visual\_Spec\_Compliant\] A simple square with a dotted line guide

⚫ **Guide:** "Let's practice another one. Follow the dotted line to make 2 equal parts."

**Prompt:** Create 2 equal parts.

\[Student follows guide\]

**SUCCESS PATH:**  
 ⚫ **Guide:** "Nice\! Two equal halves. You've got this\!"

**ERROR PATHS:**

🟠 **Light Remediation \[Meta\_Remediation\]:**  
 "Follow the dotted line."

🟠 **Medium Remediation \[Meta\_Remediation\]:**  
 "The dotted line shows where to partition."  
 *\[Visual: Dotted line glows\]*

🟣 **Heavy Remediation \[Meta\_Remediation\] \[Modeling\]:**  
 "I'll help \- watch the line appear right down the middle\!"  
 *\[Visual: System completes partition\]*

### **PROBLEM 10: \[CHALLENGE/COMP-C\] \- \[CREATE\] Advanced Application (If Succeeding)**

🔵 **Visual:** \[CLEAR\] \[Visual\_Spec\_Compliant\] Three identical rectangles appear in a row

⚫ **Guide:** "These three rectangles are exactly the same size \- they're identical wholes. Can you partition each one differently? First into 2 equal parts, second into 3 equal parts, third into 4 equal parts."

**Prompt:** Partition each rectangle into the correct number of equal parts.

\[Student partitions all three\]

**SUCCESS PATH:**  
 ⚫ **Guide:** \[Identity\_Builder\] \[Meta\_Prompt\] "Nice\! Same-sized rectangles, different partitions \- you showed real flexibility."

**ERROR PATHS:**

🟠 **Light Remediation \[Meta\_Remediation\]:**  
 "Check each rectangle: first needs 2 parts, second needs 3, third needs 4."

🟠 **Medium Remediation \[Meta\_Remediation\] \[Misconception\_\#3\]:**  
 "Remember, each rectangle is a whole. The first whole gets 2 equal parts, the second whole gets 3 equal parts, the third whole gets 4 equal parts."  
 *\[Visual: Numbers 2, 3, 4 appear above each rectangle\]*

🟣 **Heavy Remediation \[Meta\_Remediation\] \[Misconception\_\#3\] \[Modeling\]:**  
 "Let me help with one. For the middle rectangle to have thirds, I make two lines to create three equal parts. Now you try the others \- 2 parts for the first, 4 for the last."  
 *\[Visual: System demonstrates the middle rectangle only\]*

# **SYNTHESIS PHASE**

**Duration:** \~6-7 minutes  
 **Purpose:** Connect equal parts concept to broader mathematical understanding  
 **Core Fractions:** Review all five types \- halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, eighths  
 **Primary Visual Tool:** Grid arrays and shapes showing patterns  
 **Required Tags:** \[Transfer\_Thinking\], \[Meta\_Prompt\], \[Identity\_Builder\], \[Visual\_Anchor\]

## **OPENING TRANSITION**

⚫ **Guide:** "You've done some great work creating and identifying equal parts. Next, we will explore some patterns that connect lots of the problems that we worked on in this lesson."

\[Processing\_Pause \- 2 seconds\]

## **CONNECTION 1: Gallery Pattern Discovery**

🔵 **Visual:** \[CLEAR\] \[Visual\_Spec\_Compliant\] Gallery view appears showing 5 rectangles:

* Rectangle with 2 equal parts, 1 shaded  
* Rectangle with 3 equal parts, 1 shaded  
* Rectangle with 4 equal parts, 1 shaded  
* Rectangle with 6 equal parts, 1 shaded  
* Rectangle with 8 equal parts, 1 shaded

⚫ **Guide:** \[Visual\_Anchor\] "All these rectangles are exactly the same size \- they're identical wholes. What do you notice as the number of parts increases?"

**Prompt:** What pattern do you see?

\[Student selects between: \[The pieces get larger\] \[the pieces get smaller\] \[they all have equal parts\] \]

**SUCCESS PATH:**  
 ⚫ **Guide:** \[Transfer\_Thinking\] "Exactly\! The selected piece gets smaller when there are more pieces for the same whole\!"

**ERROR PATH:** 🟠 **Light Remediation \[Meta\_Remediation\]:**  
 "Look at the size of each piece as you go from 2 parts to 8 parts."

## **CONNECTION 2: Same Parts, Different Shapes**

🔵 **Visual:** \[CLEAR\] \[Visual\_Spec\_Compliant\] Three different shapes appear, all divided into fourths with 1 part shaded:

* Left: Rectangle divided into 4 vertical strips (1 shaded)  
* Middle: Circle divided into 4 wedges from center (1 shaded)  
* Right: Square divided into 4 squares using grid pattern (1 shaded)

⚫ **Guide:** \[Visual\_Anchor\] \[Meta\_Prompt\] "These shapes are all different: A rectangle, a circle, and a square. Does each shaded part represent the same part of the whole?"

**Prompt:** Does each shape represent the same part of the whole?

🔵 **Visual:** \[NEW\] \[Visual\_Spec\_Compliant\] Options appear: \[Yes \- same amount\] \[No \- different amounts\]

\[Student selects\]

**SUCCESS PATH:**  
**⚫ Guide:** \[Transfer\_Thinking\] \[Identity\_Builder\] "Yes\! You figured out something important \- it doesn't matter HOW you partition, as long as the parts are equal and the wholes are the same size. Fractions are about the relationship between parts and wholes, not just the shapes we draw."

**ERROR PATH:** 🟠 **Light Remediation \[Meta\_Remediation\] \[Misconception\_\#2\]:**

"Each shape is 1 whole. Each is divided into 4 equal parts. So each shaded part is 1/4 of 1 whole."

## **CONNECTION 3: Pattern Application**

🔵 **Visual:** \[CLEAR\] \[Visual\_Spec\_Compliant\] A sequence appears with a blank:

* Circle with 2 parts  
* Square with 4 parts  
* Hexagon with 6 parts  
* \[Blank rectangle\]

⚫ **Guide:** \[Meta\_Prompt\] "Let's see if you can apply the patterns you've discovered. This sequence shows a pattern. How many equal parts should the rectangle have?"

**Prompt:** How many equal parts fit the pattern?

🔵 **Visual:** \[NEW\] \[Visual\_Spec\_Compliant\] Options appear: \[2\] \[5\] \[6\] \[7\]

\[Student selects\]

**SUCCESS PATH:**

⚫ **Guide:** "Nice pattern recognition\! You saw 2, 4, 6, 8 \- and knew the rectangle needed 8 equal parts. You're really understanding how patterns work with equal parts\!"

**ERROR PATH:** 🟠 **Light Remediation \[Meta\_Remediation\]:**  
 "Look at the pattern: 2, then 4, then 6, then ?. What comes 2 after 6?"

## **IDENTITY CLOSURE**

🔵 **Visual:** \[MODIFY\] \[Visual\_Spec\_Compliant\] All visuals fade

⚫ **Guide:** \[Identity\_Builder\] \[System\_Leverage\] "You practiced partitioning shapes into equal parts. You worked with halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, and eighths. When you make more parts, each piece gets smaller. These patterns stayed the same in every problem you tried. The equal parts you practiced are the foundation for fraction work. Good work today."
