## DIFFICULTY LEVELS (0-4)

Difficulty increases through: **variable complexity**, **visual complexity**, and **cognitive demand**.

### Level 0 - Support
**Easiest 'wins'; boost motivation and early success**

- **Purpose:** Confidence building after struggle
- **Target:** ~10% of questions
- **Key Principle:** Simpler versions of the same skill, NOT different concepts
- **Variable Complexity:** Easiest variables (halves, 2 parts, familiar fractions)
- **Visual Design:** Single, straightforward visual with obvious, high-contrast features
- **Cognitive Demand:** Simple recognition or one-step action or heavily guided multi-step action
- **Status:** Support only (does NOT count toward mastery)

### Level 1 - Confidence
**Slightly more challenging; builds confidence**

- **Purpose:** Early practice with clear scaffolding
- **Key Principle:** The simplest possible version of the skill being taught
- **Variable Complexity:** Common variables (thirds, fourths, 3-4 parts)
- **Visual Design:** Single visual with clear, obvious features
- **Cognitive Demand:** Direct application of one concept
- **Status:** Support only (does NOT count toward mastery)

### Level 2 - Baseline
**Core assessments; mastery-level expectations begin here**

- **Purpose:** Standard mastery assessment
- **Key Principle:** Problems vary in difficulty but stay within grade-level expectations
- **Variable Complexity:** Mix of common and less common variables
- **Visual Design:** May include 2-3 visuals or moderate contrast between options
- **Cognitive Demand:** Clear task requiring understanding, not just pattern-matching
- **Status:** COUNTS TOWARD MASTERY

### Level 3 - Stretch
**Deeper exploration; builds on core understanding**

- **Purpose:** Challenge students who show baseline mastery
- **Key Principle:** Extends thinking without introducing new concepts
- **Variable Complexity:** Less familiar variables (sixths, eighths) or multiple fractions to consider
- **Visual Design:** Multiple visuals (3-4) with reduced contrast, requiring careful comparison
- **Cognitive Demand:** Multi-step reasoning or comparing multiple representations
- **Status:** COUNTS TOWARD MASTERY

### Level 4 - Challenge
**Above-grade exploration; encourages creative and flexible thinking**

- **Purpose:** Enrichment for advanced students
- **Key Principle:** Extends thinking without introducing new concepts, but with maximum complexity
- **Variable Complexity:** Most complex variables (eighths, mixed denominators) or abstract scenarios
- **Visual Design:** Many visuals (4+) with subtle differences, or abstract/decontextualized representations
- **Cognitive Demand:** Complex reasoning, ordering, or transferring across contexts
- **Status:** COUNTS TOWARD MASTERY

## DIFFICULTY PROGRESSION PRINCIPLES

**Lower Difficulty (0-1):**
- Use easier, more familiar variables
- Provide straightforward, obvious visuals with high contrast
- Keep task simple and direct
- **All levels teach the SAME core skill, just at varying complexity**

**Higher Difficulty (3-4):**
- Use more complex, less familiar variables
- Provide more visuals with less visual contrast (requires careful attention)
- Increase cognitive steps or require deeper reasoning
- **Extend thinking, never introduce different concepts**

## KEY REMINDERS

- **SUPPORT & CONFIDENCE (0-1):** Simpler versions, not different skills
- **BASELINE (2):** Varies in difficulty but always grade-appropriate
- **STRETCH & CHALLENGE (3-4):** Push boundaries without leaving the core concept
