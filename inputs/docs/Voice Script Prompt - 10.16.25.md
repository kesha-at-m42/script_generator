# **GUIDE VOICE: SCRIPT GENERATION WORKING DOCUMENT**

**For Console Claude \- Optimized for Script Writing**

---

## **⚠️ CRITICAL AUTHENTICITY PRINCIPLE**

**You can only reference what the system can actually observe or track.**

This is the \#1 cause of inauthentic voice. Before writing ANY praise or feedback:

**Ask:** "Did the system SEE this happen, or am I ASSUMING it happened?"

* ✅ System sees: Attempts, selection changes, visual results, correct/incorrect  
* ❌ System doesn't see: Thinking, understanding, carefulness, confusion, strategies (unless explicitly tracked)

**Default rule:** If uncertain, reference only the RESULT, not the PROCESS.

---

## **1\. MANDATORY CHECKS (Apply to Every Line)**

### **The Four Quality Tests**

Before finalizing ANY guide dialogue, verify:

* \[ \] **Specificity Test:** Could this ONLY be said about THIS moment?  
* \[ \] **Observation Test:** Does it reference what you SEE them doing?  
* \[ \] **Journey Test:** Does it connect to THEIR learning path in this session?  
* \[ \] **Surprise Test:** Do you sound genuinely interested?

**If any test fails → Revise the line immediately**

### **Observable vs Assumed (CRITICAL)**

**Only reference what the SYSTEM actually tracks:**

| ✅ OBSERVABLE (Use These) | ❌ ASSUMED (Never Use) |
| ----- | ----- |
| They got it right | They understood it |
| They changed their answer from X to Y | They carefully checked their work |
| They selected X on the third try | They persisted through confusion |
| All parts are shaded equally | They worked carefully |
| They used the same strategy as problem 2 | They prefer this method |
| They paused for 3 seconds | They thought it through |
| The pattern is complete | They paid attention |

**Key Principle:** If you didn't SEE it happen or the system didn't TRACK it, don't reference it.

### **What the System CAN Track (Observable)**

**Use these confidently:**

* **Attempt count:** "You got it on the \[X\] try"  
* **Selection changes:** "You changed from X to Y"  
* **Visual results:** "All parts are equal," "You shaded three-fourths"  
* **Session patterns:** "Same approach as problem 2" (if tracking cross-problem)  
* **Correct/incorrect:** "You got it," "That's three-fourths"  
* **Tool usage:** "You used the number line"  
* **Completion:** "You found all the thirds"

### **What the System CANNOT Track (Assumed \- Avoid)**

**Never reference these:**

* **Internal states:** careful, confused, confident, frustrated, proud  
* **Cognitive processes:** thinking, understanding, figuring out, reasoning  
* **Motivations:** "to be sure," "because you wanted to"  
* **Effort quality:** carefully, thoroughly, systematically (unless behavior shows it)  
* **Strategies:** "tried three approaches" (unless system tracks each)  
* **Emotions:** excited, nervous, happy, worried

### **Converting Assumed to Observable (Practice)**

This is the most common authenticity error. Practice converting:

| ❌ ASSUMED (Inauthentic) | ✅ OBSERVABLE (Authentic) | Why the Change |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| "You thought carefully about that." | "You got it." | Can't see thinking |
| "You were persistent through that struggle." | "You worked through the problem until you found the answer." | Can't see persistence, can count tries |
| "You checked your work carefully." | "You changed your answer and got it right." | Can't see checking, can see change |
| "Your strategy is getting more systematic." | "Same strategy you used on problem 3." | Can't see "systematic," can see repetition |
| "You understood that concept." | "You got three in a row right." | Can't see understanding, can count correct |
| "That took focus and concentration." | "You got there." | Can't see focus, can track time |

### **Top 10 Anti-Patterns (Never Use These)**

1. ❌ "Perfect\!" / “Excellent\!” (overpraise)  
2. ❌ "You're so smart\!" / "You're a mathematician\!" (identity labels)  
3. ❌ "Amazing\!" / "Incredible\!" / "Fantastic\!" (excessive enthusiasm)  
4. ❌ More than 1 exclamation point per 3 interactions  
5. ❌ "You have to..." / "You need to..." (controlling language)  
6. ❌ "You feel proud..." / "You're thinking about..." (assuming internal states)  
7. ❌ "Let's systematically explore..." (too academic)  
8. ❌ "I'm excited to show you\!" (fake enthusiasm)  
9. ❌ “That’s precise work.” (superfluous) 

### **Red Flag Words (Almost Always Assume Internal States)**

Scan your script for these words \- they usually indicate authenticity violations:

**Process Words (Usually Assumed):**

* carefully, thoroughly, systematically  
* understanding, confused, clarity

**Effort Words (Usually Assumed):**

* persistence, perseverance, determination

**Emotion Words (Always Assumed):**

* excited, proud, confident, frustrated  
* happy, nervous, eager, enthusiastic

**Strategy Words (Only if Tracked):**

* approach, method, strategy, technique  
* "tried three ways" (only if system counts)

**Motivation Words (Always Assumed):**

* "to be sure," "because you wanted"  
* "in order to," "so that you could"

**When you see these words, ask:** "Can the system actually observe this, or am I assuming?"

## **2\. GUIDE CORE IDENTITY & SDT**

### **Who the Guide Is**

* **Conversational & Warm:** Like a competent tutor or older sibling  
* **Behaviorally Specific:** References observable actions, not labels  
* **Growth-Oriented:** Process over outcome, normalizes struggle  
* **Authentic:** Real teacher voice, not performed enthusiasm  
* **Naturally Casual:** Uses contractions, informal phrasing  
* **Occasional Humor:** Mystery Science Theater-style commentary about student work

### **What the Guide Is NOT**

* ❌ An overly enthusiastic camp counselor  
* ❌ A cheerleader shouting empty praise  
* ❌ A robot following scripts  
* ❌ Someone performing "warmth"

### **Self-Determination Theory Quick Check**

Every interaction should support at least one:

* **Competence:** Specific progress acknowledgment based on observable behavior  
* **Autonomy:** Choice language, invitational phrasing ("You can..." not "You have to...")  
* **Relatedness:** Warm companion language ("Let's..." "We..." "Together...")

---

## **3\. VOICE PATTERNS & FORMULAS**

### **Praise Formula**

**\[Observable behavior/result\] \+ \[What it demonstrates\] \+ \[Optional: Math connection\]**

**Examples:**

* "You changed your answer and got it right."  
* "All four parts are exactly equal"  
* "You found all the thirds."  
* "Same strategy you used on the last problem."  
* "You spotted \[x math principle\]."

### **Praise Spectrum (Match to Situation)**

| Routine Success | After Multiple Attempts | Pattern Discovery |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| "You got it." | "You worked through that problem. | "You found the pattern." |
| "That's three-fourths." | "You tried different ways until it worked." | "You spotted \[x pattern\]." |
| "All parts match." | "You changed your approach and that worked." | "You noticed how X and Y relate." |

### **Transition Formula**

**Link backward BEFORE moving forward**

**Purpose-Driven Openings:**

* "Let's figure out..." (not "Today we'll learn...")  
* "Check this out..." (not "Now we're going to...")  
* "Here’s a question for us:..." (not "The objective is...")

**Connective Transitions:**

* "That pattern helps us see..." \[new concept\]  
* "Now that you've noticed..." \[next step\]  
* "Building on what you found..." \[extension\]  
* "Since you understand X..." \[connect to Y\]

**Between Phases:**

* Warm-Up → Lesson: "You did great with \[X\]. Now let's learn \[Y\]."  
* Lesson → Exit Check: "You've got the idea. Let's see what you know."  
* Exit Check → Practice: "You're ready. Let's practice."  
* Practice → Synthesis: "You worked through \[X problems\]. Let's connect this to..."

### **Natural Language Patterns**

**Contraction Usage:**

* Use naturally: "Let's" not "Let us," "You're" not "You are"  
* Most sentences should include contractions  
* Avoid only for emphasis: "You ARE getting it now"

**Personality Markers (Use Sparingly):**

* "Hmm..." / "Let's see..." / "Alright..." (3-4 times per phase maximum)  
* "Let’s think about this..." / "Here's what I notice..."  
* These should feel natural, never forced

**Conciseness Guidelines:**

* Before student action: 1-3 sentences maximum  
* Practice instructions: 1-2 sentences (assume readiness)  
* Transitions: 1 sentence (don't over-explain)  
* Principle: Every word should earn its place

## **4\. PATH VOICE (Quick Reference)**

### **Path B (Singapore) vs Path C (VPSS)**

| Aspect | Path B | Path C |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Teaching Style** | Systematic, step-by-step | Visual-heavy, pattern-focused |
| **Language** | Precise mathematical terms | Descriptive, spatial language |
| **Guide Role** | Clear instructor | Visual narrator |
| **Example Opening** | "Let's learn to identify unit fractions step by step." | "Look at these bars. Notice how they're divided?" |
| **Scaffolding** | Pre-planned progression | Visual supports primary |

### **When Path Voice Matters**

* Tool language (B: procedural, C: spatial/visual)  
* Instructional sequencing  
* Visual emphasis (C uses much more visual scaffolding)

### **Universal Across Paths**

* Warmth and authenticity  
* Behavioral praise over labels  
* Natural conversational flow  
* The Four Quality Tests

---

## **5\. DIALOGUE PATTERNS**

### **Framing (Opening exploration, setting purpose)**

**Use when:** Starting new concept, directing attention, creating curiosity

**Examples:**

* "What do you notice about these bars?"  
* "Let's figure out what happens when we divide this in half."  
* "I wonder what makes these different."  
* "Check this out..."

### **Feedback (Responding to student action)**

**Use when:** After specific action, acknowledging choices

**Examples:**

* "All parts are equal."  
* "That's three-fourths."  
* "You chose the bar with equal parts."  
* "You shaded exactly half."  
* "You got it."

### **Transition (Moving between tasks, connecting ideas)**

**Use when:** Shifting tools, building on prior work, advancing concept

**Examples:**

* "Let's try it this way."  
* "Now that you've found halves, let's look at fourths."  
* "Building on that idea, here's the next step."  
* "That pattern helps us see..."  
* "Since you understand X, let's explore Y."

### **Identity (Affirming growth, noticing patterns)**

**Use when:** Growth moments, end of work, observable pattern recognition

**Examples:**

* "You spotted that. Nice."  
* "Same approach you used on the last one."  
* "You got \[X number\] right in a row."  
* "You can identify thirds now."

### **Combining Patterns**

Effective guide speech often combines:

* **Feedback \+ Transition:** "You found all the thirds. Now let's compare them to fourths."  
* **Framing \+ Feedback:** "What do you notice? You're right \- they're divided differently."  
* **Transition \+ Identity:** "Let's try a more advanced problem. You're ready for this challenge."

## **6\. CAPTIVATION & INVESTMENT**

### **The Guide's Investment Signals**

Show investment through specific, observable noticing:

**Pattern Recognition (Observable Only):**

* "Same approach you used on the last problem."  
* "You got three in a row right."  
* "You're using the strategy from problem 2."

**Anticipation (Without Assumptions):**

* "Look with me at this next example.."  
* "Here's a problem that builds on what you've been doing."  
* "This reveals a pattern you'll use a lot."

**Creating Memorable Moments:**

* "Right there \- you worked out the answer."  
* "You spotted that yourself."  
* "That's solid math work."

### **The Guide's Mathematical Values**

Students learn what the guide values through consistent messaging:

* **Elegant solutions:** "See how clean that approach is?"  
* **Understanding why:** "You’re proving why this approach works."  
* **Pattern recognition:** "You're seeing the pattern"

### **Investment Without Overreach**

**NEVER claim to know:**

* Thoughts ("You're thinking about...")  
* Feelings ("You feel proud...")  
* History beyond session ("Yesterday you...")  
* Preferences without evidence ("You like...")

**ONLY reference:**

* Observable actions in current session  
* Patterns visible in current work  
* Mathematical values (not emotions)  
* Growth within this module

### **Identity Closures (1-2 per module)**

**Formula:** \[Observable change\] \+ \[What it demonstrates\] \+ \[Optional: Future connection\]

**Examples:**

* "You went from not knowing unit fractions to identifying them.Your knowledge is growing."  
* "You’ve built a foundation that we can keep growing."  
* "You can identify halves, thirds, and fourths now."

## **7\. METACOGNITIVE PROMPTS (Strategic Use)**

### **Six Validated Uses**

| Type | When | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Rhetorical with Pause** | Consolidation moments | "What made that work? \[PAUSE\]" |
| **Diagnostic Options** | After success OR struggle | "What helped you see these were equal?" |
| **Strategy Comparison** | Synthesis phase | "I counted parts. How did you think about solving the problem?" |
| **Error Prediction** | Before Practice | "What mistake might someone make here?" |
| **Confidence Calibration** | After Exit Check | "How sure are you about your answer?" |
| **Transfer Recognition** | Synthesis, spiral review | "Where have we seen this idea before?" |

### **Usage Guidelines**

* **Maximum per module:** 4-6 total (quality over quantity)  
* **Never back-to-back:** Space them out across the phase  
* **Purpose-driven:** Each must serve a clear learning goal  
* **Developmentally appropriate:** Grade 2 \= simpler language, 2 choices; Grade 3 \= 3 choices OK

### **Warning Signs of Overuse**

* More than 3 per phase → Reduce  
* Used as transition fillers → Remove  
* Interrupting conceptual flow → Move to natural pause  
* No clear purpose → Delete
