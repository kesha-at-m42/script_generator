# DETAILED VERSION

## **1.6 WARMUP PHASE (2-3 minutes)**

### **WARMUP PHASE GUIDANCE**

**What Warmup IS:** Warmup is an *activation* phase—it wakes up prior knowledge and creates emotional readiness for learning. Students should feel curious and capable before cognitive demand increases. Think of it as stretching before exercise: necessary, brief, and energizing.

**What Warmup is NOT:**

* ❌ NOT teaching (save instruction for Lesson)
* ❌ NOT vocabulary introduction (formal terms come in Lesson)
* ❌ NOT assessment (low-stakes exploration only)
* ❌ NOT complex problem-solving (keep it simple)

**Cognitive Load Target: 20-30%** This means quick wins, familiar concepts, simple tasks, low stakes. If a student struggles in Warmup, the task is too hard—not the student.

**Energy & Tone:** Warmup has the *highest energy* of all phases. Voice should be inviting and curious: "Let's explore..." "What do you notice?" "Check this out..." NOT "Today we will learn..." or "The objective is..."

**Remediation Approach:** Light only. Warmup is low-stakes—the bias is toward validating participation and moving forward. If a student makes an unusual choice, gently redirect OR validate their reasoning and continue. Don't stop to reteach.

**Required Structure:**

1. **Hook** (15-20 sec): Create curiosity immediately
2. **1-2 Noticing/Judgment Tasks** (60-90 sec): Student identifies or compares
3. **Bridge to Lesson** (10-15 sec): Create anticipation without teaching

### **MODULE 1 WARMUP DESIGN**

**Warmup Type:** Binary Choice (equal vs. unequal identification)

**Why This Type:** Module 1's core concept is recognizing equal parts. Binary choice tasks (which one shows X?) are the simplest format for this recognition. Students succeed by visual comparison alone—no prior fraction knowledge required.

**Prior Knowledge Activated:** Grade 2 experience partitioning shapes into halves and quarters; informal understanding that "fair shares" means same-sized pieces.

**Connection to Lesson:** Warmup establishes that "equal pieces" is a meaningful distinction. Lesson will name this distinction (partitioning) and connect it to fractions.

### **WARMUP INTERACTION BUDGET**

| Interaction | Time | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| W.1: Hook \+ First Identification | 45-60 sec | Activate "equal vs. unequal" distinction |
| W.2: Second Identification | 45-60 sec | Confirm pattern recognition; add complexity |
| W.3: Bridge to Lesson | 20-30 sec | Create curiosity about naming equal parts |
| **TOTAL** | **2-2.5 min** |  |

---

### **Interaction W.1: Hook \+ First Identification**

**Purpose:** Activate the "equal vs. unequal" distinction that students know informally from fair-sharing experiences.

**Visual:** Two pre-partitioned rectangles side by side

* Rectangle A: Divided into 2 equal parts (clear halves)
* Rectangle B: Divided into 2 unequal parts (one piece visibly larger)

**Guide creates curiosity:** Draw attention to the difference without naming it. "Both rectangles are split into two pieces—but look closely. Something's different."

**Prompt:** "Which rectangle has pieces that are exactly the same size?"

**On Correct:** Brief, warm acknowledgment. "You spotted it\! These pieces match perfectly."

**Remediation (Light only):**

* "Look at the sizes of the two pieces. Are they the same, or is one bigger?"

**What NOT to say:**

* ❌ "These are called halves" (vocabulary comes in Lesson)
* ❌ "Equal parts are important for fractions" (teaching comes in Lesson)
* ❌ "Let me show you how to check" (save scaffolding for Lesson)

---

### **Interaction W.2: Second Identification**

**Purpose:** Confirm pattern recognition with slightly more complexity (more pieces, a count-based distractor).

**Visual:** Three pre-partitioned rectangles

* Rectangle A: 4 equal parts (valid configuration)
* Rectangle B: 4 unequal parts (sizes don't match)
* Rectangle C: 3 equal parts (wrong count—tests that student attends to BOTH count and equality)

**Guide frames the task:** "Here are three more. I'm looking for the one with four pieces that are ALL the same size."

**Prompt:** "Which rectangle shows four equal pieces?"

**On Correct:** "Right\! Four pieces, all matching."

**Remediation (Light only):**

* "Count the pieces first—how many in each rectangle? Now check: are they all the same size?"

**Design Note:** Rectangle C (3 equal parts) is a purposeful distractor. If student selects it, they attended to equality but not count. Light redirect: "Those pieces are equal—but count them. How many are there?"

---

### **Interaction W.3: Bridge to Lesson**

**Purpose:** Create anticipation for Lesson without teaching. The bridge should make students *want* to learn what comes next.

**Visual:** Rectangle A from W.2 remains visible (the one with 4 equal parts)

**Guide creates curiosity gap:** "You've been finding shapes where the pieces are exactly equal. Here's what's cool—in math, equal pieces like these have special names, and there's a way to write them down. Let's figure out how that works."

**No Prompt:** This is a transition, not an interaction. Student does not act; guide speaks and moves to Lesson.

**What makes a good bridge:**

* ✅ References what student just did ("You've been finding...")
* ✅ Previews what's coming ("...have special names")
* ✅ Creates genuine curiosity ("Let's figure out...")

**What makes a weak bridge:**

* ❌ "Now let's move on to the lesson" (announcement, not anticipation)
* ❌ "Good job\! Time to learn about fractions" (tells instead of teases)

### **WARMUP CONSTRAINTS SUMMARY**

| Element | Constraint |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Vocabulary** | Use naturally: "equal," "pieces," "same size," "match." Do NOT introduce: "partition," "whole," "fraction," "halves," "fourths" |
| **Tools** | Pre-partitioned shapes for identification only. No student manipulation (no drawing, shading, or tool use) |
| **Remediation** | Light only. Validate and redirect; don't stop to reteach |
| **Cognitive Load** | 20-30%. If students struggle, simplify the task |
| **Visual States** | Maximum 2 per interaction (avoid busy screens) |
| **Duration** | 2-3 minutes maximum. If exceeding, cut content |

### **WARMUP VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

Before finalizing Warmup script, verify:

**Structure:**

* Hook present in first 15-20 seconds
* 2 identification tasks with student action
* Bridge to Lesson creates anticipation (not just announces)
* Total time under 3 minutes

**Content:**

* Prior knowledge activated (equal vs. unequal from Grade 2\)
* At least one task requires judgment ("Which shows...?")
* Visual comparison is the primary cognitive work

**Constraints:**

* No formal vocabulary introduced
* No teaching of new concepts
* No tool manipulation by student
* Remediation is Light only
* Energy is high and inviting (not instructional)

**Voice:**

* Curious, exploratory tone throughout
* "What do you notice?" framing (not "Today we will learn...")
* Brief, warm acknowledgments (not extended praise)

### **WARMUP → LESSON HANDOFF**

**What Warmup Establishes:**

* Student can visually distinguish equal from unequal parts
* Student is curious about how to name equal parts
* Student is emotionally ready for instruction

**What Lesson Will Add:**

* Formal vocabulary: "whole," "partition," "equal parts," "fraction"
* Tool introduction: Grid arrays with partition/eraser functionality
* Student creation: Making (not just identifying) equal parts
* Notation: Fraction symbols (1/2, 1/3, etc.)

**Continuity Check:** The first thing students DO in Lesson (Interaction 1.1) should feel like a natural extension of what they just SAW in Warmup.
