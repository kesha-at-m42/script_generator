# **LESSON PHASE PLAYBOOK**

**Version:** November 2025  
---

## **1\. PHASE IDENTITY**

**Core Purpose:**  
Main teaching phase where students learn the module's core concept(s) through structured instruction. This is where formal vocabulary is introduced (after visual grounding) and conceptual understanding is built systematically toward the module's learning goal(s).

**Position in Flow:**

* Follows Warmup (engagement/activation phase)  
* Precedes Exit Check (assessment phase)  
* Transition FROM Warmup: "You’ve been growing your understanding of  \[X\]. Let’s build on that knowledge with \[Y\]."  
* Transition TO Exit Check: "You've got the idea. Let's see what you know."

**Typical Duration:**  
 8-12 minutes (approximate—prioritize interaction quality over time limits)

**Interaction Count:**

* **Minimum:** 6 interactions required  
* **Typical:** 6-8+ interactions  
* **Key principle:** Let good teaching determine length, not arbitrary time limits

**Primary Focus:**

* Teaching toward the module's learning goal(s) with clear conceptual focus  
* Building from concrete visual experience to formal terminology  
* Establishing conceptual foundation for Practice phase  
* Introducing vocabulary ONLY AFTER students have visual/experiential grounding

**Energy & Tone:**

* **Energy Level:** Medium (not as high as Warmup, more instructional)  
* **Voice:** Clear, supportive, explicitly teaching  
* **Example language:** "Let's figure this out together..."  
* **Balance:** Discovery moments ("Pay attention to \[X\]” or “Do you notice \[X\]?") WITH direct instruction

**What Makes Lesson Different from Other Phases:**

| Element | Warmup | Lesson | Practice |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Purpose** | Activate curiosity | Teach core concept | Apply/consolidate |
| **Interactions** | 2+ minimum | 6+ minimum | 8-12+ problems |
| **Vocabulary** | Forbidden to teach | Introduce AFTER grounding | Use established terms |
| **Tools** | Informal exposure | Formal introduction | Application only |
| **Cognitive Load** | Light (20-30%) | Moderate to substantial | Varies by problem |
| **Remediation** | Light only, minimal | Full support available | Full support available |
| **Energy** | Medium-High (inviting) | Medium (instructional) | Medium (brief, supportive) |
| **Assessment** | None | Includes Exit Check at end | Problem-by-problem |

**Maintaining Conceptual Focus:**  
The Module Starter Pack specifies learning goal(s). The Lesson phase must teach toward those goals with clear conceptual focus—avoid scope creep.

Before writing Lesson, verify: **"What is the learning goal from the Module Starter Pack?"**

Then ask: **"Am I teaching toward this goal, or am I adding concepts not in the goal?"**

## **2\. THE CRA \+ APPLICATION SEQUENCE**

Pedagogical Foundation:  
 Lesson requires 6+ interactions because conceptual understanding develops through the CRA (Concrete-Relational-Abstract) sequence. Students need mental hooks (concrete experiences) before abstract labels can attach. This developmental progression cannot be rushed.

The Structure:

```
CONCRETE → RELATIONAL → ABSTRACT → APPLICATION
```

1\. Concrete (1-2 interactions)

* Visual/manipulative experience BEFORE any terminology  
* Student interacts with concept informally through interface (tapping, shading, selecting)  
* Builds mental hooks for vocabulary to attach to later

2\. Relational (2-3 interactions)

* Students notice patterns and relationships between concrete experiences  
* Guide facilitates discovery: "Look at these two bars—what's the same?"  
* Guide provides direct instruction when discovery isn't efficient  
* Connects concrete experiences to mathematical concepts

3\. Abstract (1-2 interaction) \- If pedagogically appropriate to the material

* Formal vocabulary introduction ONLY after Concrete and Relational complete  
* Names what students already experienced: "We call this two-thirds"  
* Follow Module Starter Pack guidance for which terms and when

4\. Application (2-3 interactions) \- If pedagogically appropriate to the material

* Students apply new vocabulary to additional examples  
* Builds toward complexity needed for Exit Check  
* Consolidates understanding with formal terms

Required Bookends:

* Opening: Clear, inviting entry (Module Pack may specify approach)  
* Bridge to Exit Check: "You've practiced this concept. Let's see what you know." (10-15 seconds)

Why This Sequence: Front-loading vocabulary creates cognitive overload because students have no mental hooks yet. The CRA sequence prevents overload by building understanding step-by-step: experience first, then pattern recognition, then formal naming, then application.

## **3\. PHASE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS**

### **3A. VOCABULARY STAGING PRINCIPLE**

**The Critical Rule:**  
 Vocabulary comes AFTER visual/experiential grounding, never before. The Module Starter Pack specifies WHAT vocabulary to introduce and WHEN. Lesson's role is to execute the introduction following the CRA sequence (Section 2).

**Why this matters:**  
 Students need mental hooks (concrete experiences) before abstract labels can attach. Front-loading vocabulary makes terms feel arbitrary and creates cognitive overload.

---

### **3B. TEACHING MOMENT PRINCIPLES**

Lesson balances facilitated discovery with direct instruction through the CRA sequence. Both are essential in a 1:1 digital learning environment.

**During Concrete & Relational Phases:**

* Highlights what to observe: "Look at these two bars—what's the same?"  
* Acknowledges their actions: "You shaded 2 out of 3 parts."  
* Uses metacognitive prompts to deepen thinking  
* Creates space for visual processing and pattern recognition

**During Abstract & Application Phases:**

* References specific student actions: "You split the bar into 4 equal parts—equal parts are the key to creating fractions."  
* Connects concepts to what student just did: "That bottom number shows how many equal parts."  
* States key concepts clearly: "Here's what matters..." "The key is..."  
* Names patterns explicitly and applies them to new examples

**When to use each approach:**

Facilitated Discovery (Concrete and Relational):

* Visual pattern recognition  
* Attribute comparison  
* Relationship noticing  
* Building curiosity before formal vocabulary

Direct Instruction (Abstract and Application):

* Formal vocabulary introduction  
* Key conceptual distinctions  
* Procedural clarification  
* Misconception correction

**Note:** Students interact through interface actions (tapping, shading, selecting), not verbal dialogue. The Guide observes their actions and responds accordingly. Metacognitive prompts (detailed in Guide Design Prompt) help students think about their thinking without requiring verbal responses.

---

### **3C. FIRST EXPOSURE VS. SUBSEQUENT**

As modules progress, students build familiarity. Adjust explanation depth accordingly.

**First Time a Concept Appears (20-30 words):**

* Concrete before abstract  
* Experience before vocabulary  
* Include the "why"  
* Complete explanation

*Example:*  
 "These are rectangle bars divided into equal parts. When all the parts are exactly the same size, we can use them to show fractions. Watch how we shade parts to show different amounts."

**Why this works:** Students need full context to build mental models. The "why" (showing fractions requires equal parts) grounds the tool's purpose. Complete sentences create confidence and understanding.

---

**Subsequent Times in Same Module (5-10 words):**

* Compressed reminder  
* Assume familiarity  
* Focus on application

*Example:*  
 "Can you show two-thirds on this bar?"

**Why this works:** Student already has the mental model. Brief instruction respects their growing expertise and maintains pacing. Over-explanation feels condescending and wastes instructional time.

---

**After Module Break/Next Module (10-15 words):**

* Brief re-anchor to prior learning  
* Key concept reminder  
* No full reteaching

*Example:*  
 "Remember equal parts from last time? Now we'll use equal parts to compare fractions."

**Why this works:** Activates prior knowledge without patronizing. The bridge ("Now we'll...") creates forward momentum while honoring what they already know.

## **4\. VOICE GUIDELINES**

**Lesson-Specific Voice Characteristics:**

The Lesson voice is distinct from Warmup (inviting, exploratory) and Practice (brief, task-focused). In Lesson, the Guide is actively teaching.

**During Discovery Moments:**

*   
* Acknowledge specific actions: "You shaded exactly 2 out of 3 parts."  
* React with authentic "aha\!" moments: "Oh\! Look what happened when you split the bar that way."  
* Share discoveries as if noticing alongside student, not waiting for them to catch up  
* Let visual processing happen before explaining

**During Direct Instruction:**

* Reference their specific actions: "Remember when you split a whole bar into 4 parts? That's what this number shows."  
* Connect new to familiar: "Now that you’re familiar with what equal parts look like, we can name them."  
* Be explicit when needed: "Keep this in mind..." "This is important..."  
* Use clear, supportive language: "Let's figure this out together."

**Lesson Energy:**

* Medium energy (not high like Warmup, not minimal like Practice)  
* Teaching mode—clear and instructional  
* Warm but focused on concept development  
* Balance encouragement with substantive feedback

*Full voice guidance in Voice Script Prompt. These are Lesson-specific adjustments only.*

## **5\. CRITICAL SUCCESS CHECKS**

**Structural Requirements:**

* Minimum 6 interactions (not counting brief Exit Check transition)  
* Opening invites learning clearly  
* Concrete (1-2 interactions) with visual grounding BEFORE any vocabulary  
* Relational (2-3 interactions) with pattern recognition and connections  
* Abstract (1 interaction) introducing formal vocabulary AFTER Concrete and Relational complete  
* Application (2-3 interactions) consolidating with new terms  
* Smooth bridge to Exit Check: "You've got the idea. Let's see what you know"

**Content Requirements:**

* Teaching ONLY toward Module Pack learning goal(s)—no scope creep beyond specified concepts  
* Vocabulary introduced after grounding (never front-loaded before concrete experience)  
* Compression appropriate: First time (20-30 words), Subsequent (5-10 words), After break (10-15 words)  
* Guide references specific student actions throughout  
* CRA sequence feels organic, not mechanical

**Common Errors to Avoid:**

| If you see this... | Fix it |
| ----- | ----- |
| Vocabulary in first 2 interactions | Move to interaction 5-6 after Concrete and Relational |
| Only 4-5 interactions total | Add interactions to complete full CRA \+ Application sequence |
| Jumping straight to formal terms | Add visual grounding and pattern recognition first |
| Teaching concepts not in Module Pack goals | Cut content—stay focused on specified learning goal(s) |
| Over-explaining familiar concepts (interaction 8 same length as interaction 1\) | Apply compression—students don't need full re-explanation |
| Rushed ending with no consolidation | Add application interactions, then confident bridge |
| Missing relational step (concrete → straight to vocabulary) | Add pattern recognition and connection-making before abstract |

## **6\. AUTHENTICITY CHECK**

Before submitting, scan your Lesson script:

**Specificity Test:**

* \[ \] Could any line work for a DIFFERENT problem? (If yes, make more specific)  
* \[ \] Did you reference what the student SPECIFICALLY did? (Must have)  
* \[ \] Does the Guide observe and respond to actual student actions?

**Pattern Variety:**

* \[ \] Would a kid notice repeated language patterns? (If yes, vary more)  
* \[ \] Are you using diverse language for similar moments?

**Teaching Authenticity:**

* \[ \] Does it sound like a real teacher watching THIS moment? (Essential)  
* \[ \] Would a student actually learn the concept from this sequence?  
* \[ \] Is vocabulary introduction natural, not forced?  
* \[ \] CRA sequence feels organic, not mechanical?

**Scope Check:**

* \[ \] Teaching toward Module Pack learning goals only (no additions)?

## **7\. GENERATION WORKFLOW**

Use this workflow while writing Lesson scripts:

**STEP 1: Verify Module Pack Requirements**

* What is the learning goal? (Focus ONLY on this)  
* What vocabulary to introduce? (Will go in Abstract phase after C and R)  
* Which misconceptions to address?  
* Which fractions/examples are required?

**STEP 2: Plan Your 6+ Interactions**

Map out the CRA \+ Application structure:

* **Interactions 1-2 (Concrete):** Visual grounding—what will students manipulate/experience first?  
* **Interactions 3-4 (Relational):** What patterns will they notice? What connections can they make?  
* **Interaction 5-6 (Abstract):** Introduce formal vocabulary—connect terms to what they already did  
* **Interactions 7+ (Application):** How will they practice using the new terms? Build toward Exit Check complexity  
* **Ending:** Brief confident bridge to Exit Check

**STEP 3: Write the Opening** Clear, inviting entry into the teaching moment (Module Pack may specify approach)

**STEP 4: Write Concrete Interactions (1-2)** Start with visual interaction—NO vocabulary yet. Use informal language: "parts," "pieces," "shaded." Let students manipulate and experience the concept through interface actions.

**STEP 5: Write Relational Interactions (3-4)** Help students notice patterns and make connections. Balance "What do you notice?" with "Here's what matters..." Guide observes their actions and builds toward formal vocabulary.

**STEP 6: Write Abstract Interaction (5-6)** NOW introduce formal vocabulary. Connect terms to what students already experienced in Concrete and Relational: "You shaded 2 out of 3 parts—we call this two-thirds."

**STEP 7: Write Application Interactions (7+)** Students practice using new vocabulary with additional examples. Build complexity toward Exit Check. Reference their specific actions throughout.

**STEP 8: Write Bridge to Exit Check** Brief, confident transition: "You've got the idea. Let's see what you know."

**STEP 9: Apply Compression Guidelines**

* First time student sees a concept: 20-30 words with full explanation  
* Subsequent times in same Lesson: 5-10 words, compressed  
* After module break: 10-15 words, brief re-anchor

**STEP 10: Final Check** Run through Quality Checks (Section 5). Verify CRA sequence is complete and vocabulary comes after grounding.
