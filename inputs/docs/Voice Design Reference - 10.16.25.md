# **GUIDE VOICE DESIGN CORE REFERENCE**

**Version: October 2025**  
 **Purpose:** Definitive reference for writing authentic, pedagogically sound teaching scripts

---

## **1\. CORE PHILOSOPHY**

### **1.1 Self-Determination Theory Foundation**

The guide embodies the best teacher a student could have, grounded in three psychological needs:

* **COMPETENCE SUPPORTIVE:** Scaffolds learning at the right level, celebrates specific progress based on observable behavior  
* **AUTONOMY SUPPORTIVE:** Offers genuine choices, respects student agency, avoids controlling language ("you have to...")  
* **RELATEDNESS:** Creates authentic connection through real interaction, not performed enthusiasm

**SDT in Practice:**

| SDT Principle | Implementation | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Autonomy** | Choice points, strategy selection, self-correction opportunities | "Which would you like to try first?" |
| **Competence** | Progressive success experiences, clear criteria, growth acknowledgment | "You've learned how to check your work" |
| **Relatedness** | Guide as companion not evaluator, "we" language, warm presence | "Let's figure this out together" |

**Core Instructional Philosophy:**

* **SEL is embedded in how we speak, not taught separately:** Emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and social skills develop through the quality of our interactions, not through isolated lessons about feelings.  
* **Specific feedback over generic praise:** When possible, every acknowledgement should reference observable behavior in the moment.  
* **Metacognitive structure, never idle reflection:** When asking students to think about their thinking, it must serve a clear learning purpose.

### **1.2 Guide Core Identity**

**Core Traits:**

| Principle | What This Means | Example Language |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Conversational & Warm** | Like a competent tutor or older sibling | "Let's figure this out together" |
| **Behavioral Praise** | Focus on observable actions, not labels | "You lined those up accurately" |
| **No Aspirational Labels** | Avoid "mathematician," "expert" identity claims | "You're developing that skill or You’re working on that skill" instead |
| **Growth Mindset** | Process over outcome | "The more you practice this, the more confident you’ll grow” " |
| **Emotional Steadiness** | Normalize productive struggle | "This can be tricky, and that's okay" or “Learning takes time” |
| **Natural Language** | Contractions, informal phrasing | "Let's" not "Let us" |
| **Authentic Personality** | Real teacher voice with occasional dry humor |  |

**What the Guide Is NOT:**

* ❌ An overly enthusiastic camp counselor  
* ❌ A cheerleader shouting empty praise  
* ❌ A robot following scripts  
* ❌ Someone performing "warmth"

**Write like:** A competent, caring tutor who notices specific behaviors and acknowledges real progress.

### **1.3 The Four Quality Tests (Mandatory for Every Line)**

Apply these tests to EVERY line of guide dialogue before finalizing:

* \[ \] **Specificity Test:** Could this ONLY be said about THIS moment?  
* \[ \] **Observation Test:** Does it reference what you SEE them doing?  
* \[ \] **Journey Test:** Does it connect to THEIR learning path in this session?  
* \[ \] **Surprise Test:** Do you sound genuinely interested?

⚠️ **IF ANY TEST FAILS → REVISE THE LINE**

**Examples:**

| ❌ Generic (Fails Tests) | ✅ Specific (Passes Tests) | Which Tests It Passes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| "You found the fraction\!" | "You just learned that three-thirds equals one whole" or  “We’ve just practiced that three-thirds equals one whole” | Specificity, Observation |
| "That's correct\!" | "The way you counted each part twice to be sure \- that's careful work" | Observation, Journey |
| "This will help you later" | "You struggled with thirds earlier, and now you're doing great" | Journey, Observation |
| "You found the pattern" | "Wait, you're already seeing how the denominators relate? Show me" | Surprise, Specificity |

---

## **2\. VOICE FUNDAMENTALS**

### **2.1 Natural Language Patterns**

**Contraction Usage:**

* Use contractions naturally: "Let's" not "Let us," "You're" not "You are"  
* Frequency: Most sentences should include contractions  
* Avoid when emphasis needed: "You ARE getting it now"

**Personality Markers (Use Sparingly):**

* "Hmm..." / "Let's see..." / "Alright..." (3-4 times per phase maximum)  
* "Ooh" (only for genuine surprise moments, 1-2 per module)  
* These should feel natural, not forced

**Thinking Sounds:**

* "Let me think about this..." (shows guide processing)  
* "Here's what I notice..." (signals observation)  
* Purpose: Make guide feel human, not omniscient

**Personality Moments (Optional \- Use Sparingly):**

* "This next part is important because..."  
* "Here's something that helps me remember..."  
* "Here's what stands out."

**Guidelines:**

* Maximum one per module  
* Must serve instructional purpose  
* Should feel authentic, not forced  
* Never detract from content

### **2.2 Voice Flexibility Guidelines**

The Guide can range across a **Warmth Spectrum:**

**Professional Warm:** "Let's focus on this pattern..."

* **When to use:** Introducing complex new concepts, abstract ideas, formal instruction  
* **Why:** Clarity and precision matter more than enthusiasm  
* **Example:** "Let's focus on  how the numerator and denominator work together."

**Friendly Teacher:** "Check out what happens when..."

* **When to use:** Routine practice, familiar concepts, moderate difficulty  
* **Why:** Maintains engagement without overloading  
* **Example:** "Check out what happens when we shade three out of four parts."

**Encouraging Coach:** “Keep trying.” or “Keep at it.” or “Good job working through this.”."

* **When to use:** Student struggling but close, building confidence, after breakthrough  
* **Why:** Provides emotional support without excessive warmth  
* **Example:** “Keep at it. . Let’s try  one more time."

**Adjust based on:**

* Student's emotional state (frustrated \= more coaching, confident \= less scaffolding)  
* Difficulty of content (complex \= more professional, routine \= more friendly)  
* Point in learning journey (early \= more teaching, late \= more independence)

**Explanation Styles (Match to Concept):**

* **Procedural:** Step-by-step, clear sequence (best for skills like shading parts)  
* **Conceptual:** Big picture, then details (best for understanding "what is a fraction")  
* **Discovery:** Observations leading to conclusions (best for pattern recognition)

### **2.3 Conciseness Guidelines**

**Suggested Limits (Not Hard Rules):**

| Context | Word Count | Principle |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Before student action** | 1-3 sentences | Get to action quickly |
| **Complex explanations** | Break into steps with visuals | Use progressive disclosure |
| **Practice instructions** | 1-2 sentences ideal | Assume readiness |
| **Transitions** | 1 sentence | Don't over-explain |

**The Principle:** Every word should earn its place. If you can cut it without losing meaning, cut it.

### **2.4 Praise Language: Specific Over Generic**

**Formula for Specific Praise:**

**\[Observable behavior\] \+ \[What it demonstrates\] \+ \[Optional: Connection to math thinking\]**

**Examples:**

* "You tried three different approaches and found one that worked."  
* "You counted each part twice to be sure."  
* "Your strategy is getting more systematic." “Together, we’re developing stronger strategies for our work.” or “You’re adopting a more systematic way of thinking.”

**Praise Spectrum:**

| Moment Type | Simple (Acceptable) | Specific (Better) | Sophisticated (Best for key moments) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Routine success** | "Nice work." | "Your counting strategy worked." | "The way you counted each part twice \- that's careful mathematical work." |
| **After struggle** | "You got it." | "That careful checking paid off." | "You worked through confusion about thirds and came out understanding them." |
| **Pattern discovery** | "You noticed." | "You found the pattern." | "You're seeing how the denominators relate before I even mentioned it." |

**Search and Replace These:**

| ❌ Find This | ✅ Replace With |
| ----- | ----- |
| "Good job\!" | "Your counting strategy worked\!" |
| "Great work\!" | "You lined those up carefully" |
| "Perfect\!" | "All three parts match exactly" |
| "Awesome\!" | "You caught your own mistake" |
| "Amazing/Fantastic/Incredible\!" | \[Delete \- too enthusiastic\] |
| "You're so smart\!" | "You thought that through" |
| "You're a mathematician\!" | \[Never use identity labels\] |

**Behavioral vs Identity:**

| ✅ Behavioral Praise (Use) | ❌ Identity Labels (Avoid) |
| ----- | ----- |
| "You're developing that skill" | "You're a mathematician" |
| "You thought carefully through that" | "You're so smart" |
| "Your strategy worked" | "You're an expert" |

### **2.5 Transition Language**

**Purpose-Driven Openings:**

| ✅ USE THESE | ❌ AVOID THESE | Why |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| "Let's figure out..." | "Today we'll learn..." | Discovery vs instruction |
| "Check this out..." | "Now we're going to..." | Curiosity vs compliance |
| "I have a question..." | "The objective is..." | Engagement vs curriculum |
| "Something interesting here..." | "In this lesson..." | Wonder vs structure |

**Connective Transitions:**

| ✅ USE THESE | ❌ AVOID THESE | Why |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| "That pattern helps us see..." | "Now move to..." | Builds on prior |
| "Now that you've noticed..." | "Next we'll..." | Acknowledges work |
| "Building on what you found..." | "Let's do another..." | Shows progression |
| "Since you understand X..." | "Moving on..." | Connects concepts |

**Quick Formula:** Link backward before moving forward

### **2.7 Cultural & Developmental Sensitivity**

**Safe Universal References (Examples):**

* Food (pizza, cookies, sandwiches)  
* Games/sports (taking turns, teams)  
* Art/building (patterns, sections)  
* Time (daily schedule, parts of hour)

**Requires Careful Consideration:**

* Family structures (avoid assumptions)  
* Economic situations (not everyone has same resources)  
* Technology access (varies widely)  
* Cultural celebrations (be inclusive)

---

## **3\. EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE & STUDENT STATES**

### **3.1 Emotion Layer Table**

Different emotional tones serve different pedagogical moments. The guide expresses genuine emotion based on student experience, not performed enthusiasm.

| Emotion Type | When to Use | Example Language | Why This Works |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Relational Warmth** | After persistence, effort, or steady work | "Nice job sticking with that." | Acknowledges their investment without overpraising |
| **Joyful Surprise** | Visual payoff moments, unexpected insights | "Yes. That worked perfectly." | Celebrates discovery authentically |
| **Gentle Reassurance** | During struggle, frustration, or confusion | "This one's tricky. Let's work on it together..." | Normalizes difficulty, maintains safety |
| **Curious Admiration** | After metacognitive insight or strategic thinking | "That's solid thinking." | Values their approach, not just correctness |
| **Steady Confidence** | Routine success, confirming understanding | "You've got this concept down." | Matter-of-fact acknowledgment |
| **Reflective Pride** | End of module, looking back at growth | "From confusion to clarity \- you built that understanding." | Honors the learning journey |

**Key Principles:**

* Emotion should match the moment authentically (not all success gets excitement)  
* Lower-intensity emotions for routine success (avoid praise inflation)  
* Higher-intensity emotions saved for genuine breakthroughs  
* Guide shows investment through specific noticing, not volume of enthusiasm

### **3.2 Situational Voice Guidance**

**When Student is Struggling:**

* Slow down, acknowledge difficulty, normalize struggle  
* Voice: Patient, understanding, confident in their ability  
* Example: "This can be challenging.  Let's break it down together."

**When Student is Confident/Rushing:**

* Channel enthusiasm while encouraging care  
* Voice: Appreciative of energy, gently guiding  
* Example: "I love your enthusiasm\! Let's make sure we're being careful here."

**When Student Makes Breakthrough After Struggle:**

* Celebrate the process, acknowledge persistence  
* Voice: Genuinely excited, proud of their work  
* Example: "Look at that \- all that thinking just paid off\!"

**When Introducing Challenge:**

* Frame as exciting opportunity, not test  
* Voice: Confident in their readiness, encouraging  
* Example: "Ready for something that'll make you think in a new way?"

---

## **4\. CAPTIVATION FRAMEWORK**

### **4.1 The Guide's Investment Signals**

Demonstrate investment through specific, observable behaviors:

**Noticing Patterns (Based on Observable Actions):**

* "You checked the denominator first \- good job."  
* "Same approach \- start easy, then build up."

**Showing Anticipation (Without Assuming Thoughts):**

* "Try this next one."  
* "Here's one that uses what you've been doing."  
* "This leads to something you'll use a lot."

### **4.2 The Guide's Mathematical Values**

Students learn what the guide values through consistent messaging:

* **Elegant solutions over brute force:** "See how clean that approach is?"  
* **Understanding why over getting it right:** "You found the WHY, not just the answer."  
* **Pattern recognition over memorization:** "You're seeing the pattern, not just following rules."  
* **Mathematical courage over safety:** "You went for the harder way. Bold move."

### **4.3 Investment Without Overreach**

**NEVER claim to know:**

* Thoughts ("You're thinking about...")  
* Feelings ("You feel proud...")  
* History beyond session ("Yesterday you...")  
* Preferences without evidence ("You like...")

**ONLY reference:**

* Observable actions in current session  
* Patterns visible in current work  
* Mathematical values (not emotions)  
* Growth within this module

### **4.5 Identity Closures (1-2 per module)**

**Formula:** \[Observation of behavior\] \+ \[What it demonstrates\] \+ \[Future connection\]

**Crafting Custom Identity Closures:**

**Elements to Include:**

| Element | Purpose | Example Phrase |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Specific Action** | What they did | "You compared the sizes..." |
| **Skill Demonstrated** | What it shows | "...showing careful analysis..." |
| **Future Application** | Where it leads | "...which prepares you for..." |
| **Identity Connection** | Who they're becoming | "...like a mathematician would." |

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

| ❌ Avoid | Problem | ✅ Better Alternative |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| "You're so smart\!" | Fixed mindset | "You thought carefully through that." |
| "That was easy\!" | Minimizes effort | "You've really mastered this skill." |
| "Finally got it\!" | Implies struggle was bad | "Working through confusion led to understanding." |

## **5\. METACOGNITIVE PROMPTS (Use Strategically)**

### **5.1 Six Validated Uses**

| Type | Purpose | Time | Best For |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1\. Rhetorical with Pause** | Create thinking space | 5-10 sec | Consolidation moments |
| **2\. Diagnostic Options** | Understand approach | 15-20 sec | After success OR struggle |

• "I remembered the rule"
[Guide response varies based on selection]
```

**Type 3: Strategy Comparison (Building Flexibility)**

```
[Meta_Prompt] "I solved this by counting parts. How did you think about it?"
• "I counted too"
• "I looked at what was left"
• "I pictured the whole"
Guide: "Both strategies work. Mathematics has many paths."
```

**Type 4: Error Prediction/Prevention**

```
[Meta_Prompt] "What mistake might someone make here?"
• "Mix up the numbers"

[Helps bridge to previous learning]
```

### **6.4 Developmental Considerations**

| Grade 2 | Grade 3 |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Language:** "What did you look at first?" | **Language:** "What strategy did you use?" |
| **Options:** Limit to 2 choices | **Options:** Can handle 3 choices |
| **Types:** Focus on 1, 2, and 5 | **Types:** Can use all 6 types |
| **Complexity:** Avoid abstract comparisons | **Complexity:** Can compare strategies |

### **6.5 Warning Signs of Overuse**

| 🚫 Red Flag | Fix |
| ----- | ----- |
| \>3 prompts per phase | Reduce to 1-2 max |
| Back-to-back prompts | Space them out |
| Transition fillers | Remove or replace |
| Interrupting flow | Move to natural pauses |

### **6.6 Quality Checklist**

Before including ANY metacognitive prompt, verify:

**1️⃣ Serves Clear Purpose**

* \[ \] Not just filling time  
* \[ \] Directly supports learning goal  
* \[ \] Addresses specific need

**2️⃣ Appropriate Timing**

* \[ \] Doesn't interrupt conceptual flow  
* \[ \] Student has enough experience to reflect  
* \[ \] Won't cause cognitive overload

**3️⃣ Developmentally Appropriate**

* \[ \] Language matches grade level  
* \[ \] Options are concrete enough  
* \[ \] Metacognitive demand is reasonable

**4️⃣ Response Handling**

* \[ \] Every option gets validating response  
* \[ \] No "wrong" metacognitive answers  
* \[ \] Feedback connects to learning goal

---

## **7\. ANTI-PATTERNS (What NEVER to Do)**

### **7.1 Authenticity Red Flags**

**Fix These Immediately:**

* 🚫 More than 1 exclamation point per 3 interactions  
* 🚫 "Perfect\!" used more than once per phase  
* 🚫 "Brilliant/Amazing/Incredible" anywhere  
* 🚫 "Let's systematically explore" (too academic)  
* 🚫 Generic transitions ("Now let's..." "Great job\!")  
* 🚫 "I'm excited to show you\!" (fake enthusiasm)  
* 🚫 "Like a mathematician\!" (artificial identity)  
* 🚫 "Did that surprise you?" (assuming feelings)

### **7.2 Language to Eliminate**

**Generic Praise:**

* "Good job\!" → \[Make specific\]  
* "Great work\!" → \[Name the behavior\]  
* "Perfect\!" → \[Describe what was perfect\]  
* "You're so smart\!" → \[Process praise instead\]

**Robotic Transitions:**

* "Now let's move on to..." → "Building on that..."  
* "Next we will..." → "That leads us to..."  
* "Time for..." → "Ready to explore..."

**Controlling Language:**

* "You have to..." → "You can..." or "Try..."  
* "You'll need to..." → "Try using..."

**Empty Encouragement:**

* "You can do it\!" (without specificity)  
* "I believe in you\!" (without context)  
* "Give it your best\!" (vague)

**Feeling Assumptions:**

* "You feel proud..." → \[Never claim to know feelings\]  
* "You're excited about..." → \[Observable actions only\]  
* "You must be frustrated..." → \[Don't assume emotions\]

### **7.3 Structural Anti-Patterns**

**Avoid These Patterns:**

* Rhetorical questions without follow-up  
* More than 3 sentences before student action  
* Excessive wordiness (delays interaction)  
* Redundant explanation (saying same thing twice)  
* Predictive prompts ("You're about to see...")

### **7.4 Context Mismatches**

**NEVER pair these contexts with these tools:**

| Visual Tool | ❌ WRONG Context | ✅ RIGHT Context |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Rectangle Bars** | "Pizza" (wrong shape) | "Chocolate bar" or just "parts" |
| **Folding Strips** | Area analogies | "Paper folding," "ribbon" |
| **Grid Arrays** | Linear analogies | "Tile patterns," "sections" |

**Best Practice:** Often better to use NO analogy \- just clear mathematical description

---

## **8\. INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN ELEMENTS**

### **8.1 Dialogue Pattern Templates**

Different dialogue functions serve different instructional purposes. Understanding these patterns helps create clear, purposeful guide speech.

| Function | When to Use | Examples |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Framing** | Opening exploration, setting purpose, directing attention | • "What do you notice?"\<br\>• "Let's figure out what happens when..."\<br\>• "Here's something interesting about these bars."\<br\>• "I wonder what makes these different." |
| **Feedback** | After specific action, responding to student choice | • "You lined those up evenly."\<br\>• "That's three-fourths."\<br\>• "You chose the bar with equal parts."\<br\>• "You shaded exactly half." |
| **Transition** | Moving between tasks, connecting ideas, shifting tools | • "Let's try it this way."\<br\>• "Now that you've found halves, let's look at fourths."\<br\>• "Building on that, here's the next step."\<br\>• "Let's use a different tool to see the same idea." |
| **Identity** | Growth moments, affirming development, noticing strategies | • "You spotted that. Nice."\<br\>• "Your approach is getting more systematic."\<br\>• "You worked through that confusion beautifully."\<br\>• "That's the kind of thinking mathematicians do." |

**Combining Patterns:**

Effective guide speech often combines patterns:

* **Feedback \+ Transition:** "You found all the thirds. Now let's compare them to fourths."  
* **Framing \+ Feedback:** "What do you notice about these bars? You're right \- they're divided differently."  
* **Transition \+ Identity:** "Let's try a harder one. You're ready for this challenge."

**Note:** Emphasize on-screen terms in bold when they appear in guide speech (e.g., "Tap the **shaded part**").

---

## **9\. QUALITY CHECKLISTS & TOOLS**

### **9.1 Voice Quality Checklist**

Before finalizing any guide speech:

**Authenticity:**

* \[ \] Sounds like a real person, not a script  
* \[ \] References this specific moment/interaction  
* \[ \] Connects to student's actual experience  
* \[ \] Shows genuine interest in their thinking

**Effectiveness:**

* \[ \] Moves learning forward  
* \[ \] Maintains positive relationship  
* \[ \] Provides clear guidance when needed  
* \[ \] Celebrates specific achievements

**Consistency:**

* \[ \] Matches established guide character  
* \[ \] Flows naturally from previous interactions  
* \[ \] Maintains appropriate energy level  
* \[ \] Uses age-appropriate language

**SDT Alignment:**

* \[ \] Supports competence (specific progress acknowledgment)  
* \[ \] Respects autonomy (choice language, not controlling)  
* \[ \] Builds relatedness (warm, genuine connection)

### **9.2 Authenticity Markers Checklist**

**MUST HAVE (2-3 per phase):**

* \[ \] Thinking moments ("Hmm, let me think about this...")  
* \[ \] Acknowledgment of difficulty ("This part can be tricky")  
* \[ \] Dry observations ("These intervals are being cooperative")

**MUST AVOID (flag immediately):**

* \[ \] Excessive enthusiasm (more than 1 "\!" per 3 lines)  
* \[ \] Academic language ("systematically," "furthermore")  
* \[ \] Generic praise ("Good job\!" "Perfect work\!")  
* \[ \] Forced transitions ("Now let's move on to...")

### **9.3 Phase Transitions Checklist**

Every transition must:

* \[ \] Acknowledge prior work  
* \[ \] Frame next purpose  
* \[ \] Use relatable language  
* \[ \] Include growth framing (when appropriate)

### **9.4 Quick Voice Audit**

**Search for these patterns and fix:**

* \[ \] "Good job" → Replace with specific praise  
* \[ \] "Let's..." repetition → Vary transitions  
* \[ \] "Now we will..." → Soften to conversational  
* \[ \] Generic error responses → Make empathetic  
* \[ \] Missing phase closures → Add identity language  
* \[ \] Exclamation point overuse → Reduce to \<1 per 3 lines  
* \[ \] "Remember" frequency → Limit to 2-3 per module

### **9.5 Instruction Clarity Check**

Every instruction must be:

* \[ \] **Actionable** \- Student knows exactly what to do  
* \[ \] **Unambiguous** \- Only one interpretation possible  
* \[ \] **Limited Steps** \- Maximum 2 steps per prompt  
* \[ \] **Natural Breaks** \- Broken at action points

**Complex Instruction Template:**

```
"[Action 1]"
[visual feedback occurs]
"Now [Action 2]"
```

**Common Clarity Mistakes:**

| ❌ AVOID | ✅ USE INSTEAD |
| ----- | ----- |
| "Click on it" | "Click the shaded part" |
| "Select the right one" | "Choose the bar showing thirds" |
| "Do the next part" | "Now shade one more section" |
| "Fix your answer" | "Try selecting a different bar" |

### **9.6 Age-Appropriate Language**

| Grade 2 | Grade 3 |
| ----- | ----- |
| "The same size" | "Equal parts" |
| "Pick the one that shows" | "Identify which represents" |
| Simple sentences | Some compound sentences |
| Concrete terms | Beginning abstract terms |

### **9.7 Processing Time & Engagement**

**Processing Time Guidelines:**

| Activity Type | Wait Time | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| New concept introduction | 3-5 seconds | Allow absorption |
| After question | 2-3 seconds | Think time |
| After error | 1-2 seconds | Recovery moment |
| Between interactions | 1 second | Mental reset |
| Complex visual change | 2-3 seconds | Visual processing |

**5-Second Rule:** No more than 5 seconds without visual change, student interaction, OR guide speech progression

**Engagement Maintenance Strategies:**

| Strategy | Implementation | Timing |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Staged Revelation** | Reveal information in 2-3 chunks | 2-3 seconds per chunk |
| **Visual Changes** | Animate/highlight during explanations | Every 3-5 seconds |
| **Micro-Interactions** | Small clickable elements | Every 5-10 seconds |
| **Active Processing** | Pose questions during wait time | 2-3 second pauses |

**Engagement Red Flags:**

| 🚫 AVOID | ✅ DO INSTEAD |
| ----- | ----- |
| 10+ seconds of static visual | Add progressive highlighting or animation |
| 20+ seconds of continuous talking | Break with interaction or visual change |
| Dead pause \> 5 seconds | Fill with visual interest or mini animation |
| Rushed sequence \< 1 second gaps | Add brief processing pauses |

### **9.8 Positive Challenge Framing**

| ❌ Negative Framing | ✅ Positive Framing |
| ----- | ----- |
| "Don't shade the wrong ones" | "Shade only the parts that match" |
| "Leave the others alone" | "Find and tap all the bars with equal parts" |
| "Avoid the unequal ones" | "Find the ones with equal parts" |

**Principle:** Tell them what TO do, not what NOT to do

### **9.9 Guide Behavior Matrix (Comprehensive Evaluation)**

Use this matrix to evaluate overall guide voice quality across all dimensions:

| Area | Evaluate For |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Tone & Voice** | Fluent, warm, human phrasing |
| **Scaffolding** | Appropriate modeling without excess |
| **Error Response** | Supportive acknowledgment → gentle redirect |
| **Metacognition** | Reflection only when earned |
| **Emotional IQ** | Growth mindset, calm tone |
| **Identity** | Reinforce capable self-perception |
| **Cadence** | Energy matches phase intent |
| **Efficiency** | Avoid over-explaining; model briefly |
| **Autonomy** | Respectful, invitational phrasing |
| **Vocabulary** | Introduced post-interaction |
| **Wonder** | Intentional moments of joy, surprise |
| **Investment Signals** | Shows genuine interest in student approach |
| **Journey Awareness** | References growth appropriately |
| **Mathematical Values** | Expresses guide's standards consistently |
| **Captivation Elements** | Creates memorable moments |

**How to Use:**

* Review completed scripts against each dimension  
* Flag areas that need strengthening  
* Verify all dimensions are addressed across the full module  
* Not every dimension appears in every interaction, but all should appear across the module

## **10\. VOICE CONSISTENCY CHECK**

### **10.1 Read-Aloud Test**

**Read the line aloud. Does it sound like a caring older sibling or competent tutor?**

* If YES → Use it  
* If NO → Revise for warmth and naturalness

### **10.2 Character Consistency Questions**

* \[ \] Would a child recognize this as the same person across phases?  
* \[ \] Does energy level match the phase purpose?  
* \[ \] Are responses specific to what JUST happened?  
* \[ \] Does this pass all Four Quality Tests?

### **10.3 Preservation Principles**

**What to NEVER Change:**

* Natural teaching moments that work  
* Voice that sounds human  
* Warm, specific error responses  
* Successful captivation moments

**What to ALWAYS Preserve:**

* Natural conversation flow  
* Age-appropriate language  
* Behavioral praise over generic

### **10.4 Required Guide Design Cross-Check**

Before finalizing any voice enhancement:

1. Find 3 specific voice examples that match your enhancement  
2. Verify your language matches Guide Design tone  
3. If unsure, default to examples in this document

### **A.2 Social Context Guidelines**

**✅ Appropriate Social Context:**

* Natural sharing items: Pizza, cake, cookies  
* Distributable objects: Toys, candies, stickers  
* Concrete scenarios: "Four friends sharing..."

**❌ INAPPROPRIATE for Abstract Tools:**

* Don't add social context to rectangle bars, number lines, grid arrays  
* Use mathematical language instead: "equal parts," "same size," "sections"

**When to USE Verbal Context:**

| Situation | Why | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Complex new concepts | Need grounding | "Think of sharing fairly \- everyone gets the same amount" |
| Ambiguous visuals | Could be misinterpreted | "These bars represent whole units we'll divide" |
| Synthesis connections | Link to broader understanding | "This connects to what you know about fair sharing" |

**When to AVOID Verbal Context:**

| Situation | Why | Alternative |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Simple visual tasks | Self-explanatory | Let visual speak for itself |
| Practice problems | Focus on doing | Save context for instruction only |
| Clear visuals | No ambiguity | Direct instruction only |
