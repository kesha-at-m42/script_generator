## **1.8 PHASE-SPECIFIC SCRIPT GUIDANCE \- PATH C (VPSS)**

**FOR CLAUDE:** This is your primary section for script generation. Everything you need for Path C is consolidated here.

**CRITICAL PACING PRINCIPLE:** All timing estimates guide script structure and relative emphasis, not rigid requirements. Good teaching always wins over hitting exact minutes. If students need more time to process, take it. If they're ready to move faster, do. The pedagogical flow and student understanding matter more than the clock.

### **PATH VOICE & APPROACH**

| Element | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Core Method** | Visual-first pattern discovery using grid arrays and pattern tiles |
| **Voice Calibration** | "Look with me at how these patterns show..." "See how the tiles..." "The grid reveals..." |
| **Visual Commitment** | Always show whole before partitioning; emphasize visual verification through overlay/comparison |
| **Unique Strength** | Concrete visual proof of equality through matching grid units or overlaying tiles |
| **Risk to Manage** | Building too much dependence on grid scaffold (will address in Modules 4-7) |

### **🔥 WARM-UP** 

**CORE PURPOSE:**  
 Activate pattern recognition for equal parts; create engagement with visual exploration

**STRUCTURE:**

* **Hook:** "Let’s look at these tile arrangements \- which shows equal groups?" \[Show pre-arranged options\]  
* **Discovery:** Students identify patterns of equality through visual comparison  
* **Bridge:** "Can you make 2 equal parts using these rectangles?"

#### **INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS**

* **Vocabulary:** Use "equal" and "parts" naturally \- callback only, no formal introduction  
* **Continuity:** Light callback if relevant: "Remember seeing shapes divided into parts?"  
* **Misconception Watch:** M1.1 may trigger if student accepts unequal "close enough"  
* **Digital Tool:** \[Tool\_Intro\] Grid rectangles (familiar start) \- first exposure  
* **Visual:** Pre-divided grid rectangles; pattern tile arrangements

#### **SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS ✅ Must Include**

* **Say:** "Look at these patterns \- what do they show?"  
* **Say:** "Which rectangle is divided equally?"  
* **Show:** Grid rectangles with 2-4 divisions (some equal, some unequal)  
* **Do:** Student clicks/selects equal partition  
* **Check:** "How can you tell those parts are equal?" (visual verification)

#### **SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS ❌ Never Allow**

* Don't use formal vocabulary yet (no "partition," "fraction")  
* Don't exceed 3 minutes  
* Don't introduce fraction notation  
* Don't say: "These are called fractions" or other premature naming

#### **TONE & PACING**

* **Tone:** Curious, exploratory; "Let's explore..." "What do you notice?"  
* **Pacing:** Allow 10-15 seconds for visual scanning; pause after questions  
* **Energy:** Calm but engaged; emphasis on visual discovery

### **📚 LESSON**

#### **CORE PURPOSE:**  Develop understanding that fractions require equal parts; learn to create equal partitions; name them with words, then with mathematical notation

#### **PEDAGOGICAL FLOW:** Module 1 teaches partitioning, shading, and naming as an integrated progression. The lesson moves through three sections: (1) Grid mastery with fraction words, (2) Notation introduction, (3) Hexagon extension with full naming. This sequence preserves immediate connection (partition→shade) while building from concrete spatial work to abstract notation, leveraging VPSS spatial reasoning strengths.

#### **KEY PEDAGOGICAL PRINCIPLE:** Students partition and shade IMMEDIATELY throughout, but naming progresses: fraction words first (Section 1), then notation (Section 2+). This maintains engagement and immediate feedback while allowing spatial pattern mastery before introducing symbols. Shading reinforces "X of Y equal parts" from the start, creating concrete understanding that notation later names.

#### **TEACHING SEQUENCE**

 **1: GRID MASTERY WITH FRACTION WORDS (No Notation Yet)**

**CRITICAL MOMENT 1: Introducing "The Whole"**

| Element | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| **What Happens** | Establish complete shape as "one whole" before any partitioning; students identify whole shapes |
| **Key Visual** | Complete grid rectangle with clear boundary;  |
| **Guide Framing**  | "Look at this shape. Before we divide it, this is one whole \- all of it together \- is what we're starting with."  |
| **Vocabulary** | Introduce "whole" using script: "This entire shape \- all of it together \- is our WHOLE" |
| **Check** | "Click the whole shape" (verification) |
| **Misconception Prevention** | Establish clear boundary before partitioning prevents M1.2 (misidentified whole) |
| **Tool** | Grid rectangles (entry point for VPSS) |
| **Why This Tool** | Visual patterns and repeating grid structures most intuitive for spatial thinkers; "these shapes match" builds toward formal equality |

---

**CORE DEVELOPMENT** (This is the heart of the lesson \- give it time)

**CRITICAL MOMENT 2: Creating and Naming with Words (Halves, Fourths)**

| Element | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Tool Orientation (Before Student Creates)** | **Guide demonstrates partition and eraser functionality:** "Before you try, let me show you a helpful tool. If you make a cut you don't like..." \[Guide places partition line\] "...you can hover over the line and click to erase it. Watch\!" \[Guide erases line\] **Student practices:** "Now you try \- hover over that line and click to erase it." \[Student erases a pre-placed line\] **Why now:** Students need to know they can fix mistakes before attempting their first partition. Reduces anxiety and encourages experimentation. |
| **What Happens** | Students partition rectangles into 2 then 4 equal parts using grid arrays; immediately shade one part after each partition; use WORDS to name (no notation yet) |
| **Builds From** | Whole concept just established |
| **New Element** | Creating equal parts \+ selecting parts through shading \+ naming with fraction words |
| **Sequence for Each Fraction:** | Partition: "Click to make two equal parts" (1x2 grid) Shade: "Shade one part" (immediate after partition) Name: "You shaded one of two equal parts \- that's one HALF" Verify: "Count grid units- are they equal?" |
| **Example Progression:** | Halves (1x2 grid): Partition → Shade 1 → "That's one half" → Check equality Fourths (1x4 AND 2x2 grid): Partition → Shade 1 → "That's one fourth" → Check equality |
| **Vocabulary Staging** | After creating halves/fourths: "When we split something into equal pieces, we call that PARTITIONING" After fourths: "When all parts are the same size, we call them EQUAL PARTS"  |
| **Language Emphasis** | Use fraction words naturally throughout ("halves," "fourths") \- students hear mathematical language before seeing symbols |
| **Check** | "You made \[X\] equal parts." After shading: "You shaded one part \- that's one \[fraction word\]." If verification needed, use selection task: "Click the number that shows how many equal parts" \[2\] \[3\] \[4\] |
| **Misconception Prevention** | Grid verification prevents M1.1 (unequal parts accepted) |
| **Tool** | Grid arrays (1D and 2D options) |
| **Why This Tool** | Countable units make equality provable; shading provides immediate visual feedback; grid structure supports both linear (1x4) and area-based (2x2) thinking |

---

**CRITICAL MOMENT 3: Pattern Extension (Thirds, Sixths, Eighths) \- Still Words Only**

| Element | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| **What Happens** | Extend to 3, 6, 8 equal parts; discover doubling pattern (2→4→8, 3→6); continue partition → shade → name with WORDS pattern |
| **Builds From** | Success with halves/fourths AND understanding of sequence New Element: More complex partitions; 2D grids for sixths (area-based thinking) Sequence Maintained: For EACH new fraction type, students partition → shade immediately → name with word |
| **New Element** | More complex partitions; pattern recognition across partition types |
| **Example** | Thirds (1x3 grid): Partition: "Try making three equal parts" Shade: "Please shade one part" Name: "That's one THIRD" Pattern Prompt: "You've made halves, fourths, thirds \- do you notice a pattern in how these parts are named?" Sixths (2x3 OR 3x2 grid \- AREA-BASED): Strategy: "First split in half, then split each half into three" (explicit demonstration) Partition: Student creates 2x3 array Shade: "Please shade one part" Name: "That's one SIXTH" Check: "Let’s count all the grid units \- six equal parts" VPSS Advantage: 2D grid shows sixths as spatial arrangement (2 rows × 3 columns), not just linear division Eighths (2x4 OR 4x2 grid): Strategy: "Start with halves, then fourths, then eighths" (repeated halving shown) Partition: Student creates 2x4 array Shade: "Can you shade one part?" Name: "That's one EIGHTH" Pattern Recognition: "What happens when we double the number of  parts? The pieces get smaller. |
| **Vocabulary** | Introduce "equal parts" formally after multiple experiences |
| **Language Pattern Discovery** | "Let’s look at the words \- halves, thirds, fourths, sixths, eighths \- they describe how many parts" |
| **Check** | "You made \[X\] equal parts. One of those parts is one \[fraction word\]." For active verification: "Click how many equal parts you see" \[3\] \[4\] \[6\] or "Select what we call one of these parts" \[third\] \[fourth\] \[sixth\]  |
| **Tool** | Grid arrays (emphasize 2D arrangements for sixths and eighths) |
| **Why This Tool** | 2D grids distinguish VPSS from Singapore's linear approach; students think about arranging equal regions in space, not just dividing length Why Words First: Students recognize and use mathematical language before abstract symbols; auditory pattern recognition ("thirds," "fourths") builds understanding that notation will later represent |
| **End of Section 1** | Students can partition grids (1D and 2D), shade to show "one part," and name using fraction words. They've experienced all 5 fraction types with immediate partition→shade→name connection. Ready for notation introduction. |

---

**CRITICAL MOMENT 4: Mathematical Notation Bridge**

| Element | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| **What Happens** | After solid experience with fraction words across all types, introduce notation as the written form of what they've been saying |
| **Builds From** | Fluency with partition → shade → name using words |
| **New Element** | Mathematical symbols (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6, 1/8) |
| **Key Bridge** | "You've been saying 'one-fourth' \- mathematicians can write ‘one-fourth’ using numbers" |
| **Notation Introduction Sequence:** | Show Example: Display a partitioned, shaded grid with fourths Connect Language: "We've been saying 'one fourth'" Reveal Symbol: "We write it like this: 1/4" Explain Structure: "The bottom number tells us how many equal parts we made. The top number tells us how many parts we selected." Demonstrate: Point to shaded grid \- "See? We made 4 equal parts, and shaded 1\. That's 1/4." |
| **Vocabulary** | Introduce "fractions": \[Vocabulary\_Staging\] "These equal parts can be named with FRACTIONS \- numbers that show parts of a whole" |
| **Application (2-3 examples on grids):** | Example 1: Show partitioned thirds with one shaded → "We've been calling this 'one-third' \- now we write 1/3" Example 2: "Please partition a grid into sixths andshade one part" → Student partitions and shades → Guide: "What fraction is shaded?" → "1/6" Example 3: Show multiple grids (halves, fourths, eighths) → "Match the notation: which shows 1/2? which shows 1/8?" |
| **Notation Explanation Emphasis** | Bottom number \= denominator \= how many equal parts in the whole Top number \= numerator \= how many parts we're talking about (shaded) Connection: "You already KNOW these fractions \- now you know how to WRITE them" |
| **Check** | "Which number tells us the total parts?" "Which number shows what's shaded?" "What fraction is this?" |
| **Important** | Students RECOGNIZE notation matched to visuals they created; focus on reading and matching, not independent writing yet |
| **Tool** | Grid arrays (same tool, new layer of abstraction) |
| **Why Introduce Here** | Students have spatial mastery \+ vocabulary; notation names what they deeply understand; introducing on familiar tool (grids) keeps cognitive load manageable |
| **End of Section 2** | Students understand notation structure, can match symbols to partitioned/shaded grids, and recognize that notation represents the words they've been using |

---

**Section 3: HEXAGON EXTENSION (Apply Full Skill)**

**CRITICAL MOMENT 5: Shape Transfer with Complete Naming**

| Element | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| **What Happens** |  Extend equal partitioning to hexagons; students now apply full partition → shade → name with NOTATION sequence to new shape |
| **Builds From** | Notation understanding from Section 2 |
| **New Element** | Multi-sided shape with 6 sides; symmetrical structure with angles; complete naming skill applied |
| **Transfer Challenge** | "You've worked with grids. Can you show equal parts on a hexagon?" |
| **Shape Introduction** | Show complete hexagon: "This is our whole \- a hexagon with 6 sides" Key Difference: "Instead of counting grid units, we'll look at sections with straight edges" Verification Method: "Count sides in each section to check equality" |
| **Partitions Covered** | Halves, thirds, sixths (2, 3, 6\) \- natural divisions of hexagon |
| **Sequence for Each (Full Skill)** | Partition: "Can you make  \[X\] equal parts on this hexagon?" Shade: "Please shade one part" Name WITH notation: "What fraction is shaded?" → "1/3" Verify: "When we count the sides, are the sections equal?" |
| **Example Progression** | Halves on hexagon: Partition → Shade → "That's 1/2" (TRANSFER from grid understanding) Thirds on hexagon: Partition → Shade → "That's 1/3" Sixths on hexagon: Partition → Shade → "That's 1/6" |
| **Cross-Tool Comparison** | "After hexagon mastery, show side-by-side: Grid with fourths (2x2 shaded) showing 1/4 | Hexagon with thirds (1 section shaded) showing 1/3 Guide: "Different shapes, different partitions, but the same notation system works for both" Check: "What stayed the same? The notation shows equal parts on any shape" |
| **Pedagogical Advantage** | Straight edges and visible angles make equality verifiable without grid Symmetry provides visual proof Students see that notation transcends specific tools Prepares for circles in Module 2 (curves are next complexity level) |
| **Module 1 Focus** | Multiple hexagon partitioning experiences; build familiarity and confidence with angled shapes |
| **Important Note** | Circles come in Module 2 \- "Hexagons have straight edges you can count. After more practice, you'll be ready for circles which have curves instead |
| **Purpose** | Complete Module 1 shape progression from grid-supported (rectangles) to straight-edge multi-sided (hexagons); demonstrate that equal parts work across shapes; apply notation in new context |
| **Tool** | Hexagons with partition drawing tool |
| **Why This Tool** | After grid mastery \+ notation understanding, students ready for shape variation. Hexagons' straight edges are easier than curves while still increasing spatial complexity. Maintains verification methods (count sides/sections) while showing transferability. |
| **Why After Notation** | Students arrive with full skill set (partition, shade, name), making transfer explicit rather than learning everything simultaneously |
| **End of Section 3** | Students can partition, shade, and name with notation on BOTH grids and hexagons; understand that notation works across shapes |

---

**SYNTHESIS MOMENT: Connecting the Learning**

| Element | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| **What Happens** | Brief review connecting grids and hexagons; prepare for independent work |
| **Visual Summary** | Show 2-3 examples of fractions on both tools |
| **Key Message** | ""You learned to partition grids AND hexagons into equal parts, shade them, and name them with fractions. You're ready to practice on your own." |
