# **📘 M42 SCRIPT SCORE RUBRIC** 

Version Updated 9/15/25

### **✏️ PURPOSE**

This rubric ensures clarity, effectiveness, and system alignment in all guide-led instructional scripts for Grades 2–3 math. It supports improvement at four levels: line, document, module, and unit.

---

## **✅ RUBRIC 1: CORE PEDAGOGY & EFFECTIVENESS (Score 1–10)**

| Criterion | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Standards Alignment** | Content matches CCSS/TEKS and the assigned learning goal |
| **Method & Visualization** | Matches assigned pedagogical method and visual logic |
| **Subskills & Prerequisites** | Includes all necessary conceptual/building-block skills |
| **Misconception Handling** | Anticipates or remediates known student errors, including **\[Misconception\_Remediation\]** |
| **Academic Vocabulary** | Accurate and developmentally appropriate vocabulary use |
| **Readability** | Clear, concise, and accessible phrasing Every learner-facing task includes an explicit *Visual:* description (clear, concise, spatially anchored) and *Prompt:* line (exact student action) as per Script Writing Prompt visual description rules. |
| **Cognitive Load** | Manages segmentation, clarity, and memory demands |
| **Effectiveness** | Concept is clearly and completely taught. All canonical fractions in the Learning Goal (e.g., 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6, 1/8) appear in *both* Lesson and Practice phases.Symbolic integration timing must match the Full List tab. |
| **Narrative Coherence** | Visuals and guide speech flow logically and support understanding |
| **Metacognitive Support** | Uses **\[Meta\_Remediation\]** or **\[Meta\_Prompt\]** to strengthen learner thinking |
| **Remediation Complete** | very interaction has appropriate remediation depth |

Visual tool use, affordances, constraints, and misuse risks must match *Visualization Specs*. All primary and secondary visuals per phase must match the relevant ‘Full List’ tab in *Grade 3, Unit 5, Visualizations.xlsx*.

## **✅ RUBRIC 2: GUIDE CHARACTER & EMOTIONAL TONE (Score 1–10)**

| Criterion | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Humanized Voice** | Guide sounds warm, real, and engaging |
| **Emotional Validation** | Acknowledges student effort and feelings when appropriate |
| **Celebrates Growth** | Reinforces persistence and identity growth |
| **Expresses Care** | Shows student is seen and supported |
| **Supports Autonomy** | Uses choice, remediation framing, and rationale; avoids overly directive tone |
| **Tone & Pacing** | Rhythm, word choice, and delivery match student developmental level. All transitions are warm, connective, and conceptually framed — avoid generic phrases like “Now let’s start” or “Next activity.” |
| **Strategic Normalization** | Mistakes are framed as normal and learnable |
| **Adaptive SEL** | SEL is used appropriately based on context and learner readiness |
| **Conversational Fit & Authenticity** | peech is natural, developmentally tuned, and free of odd phrasing or awkward transitions. Avoids vague or unnatural phrases like “the split’s so good,” “fair split,” “want to try again?” |
| **🔶 Phrase-Level Red Flag** | Language sounds robotic or unnatural (tag with **\[Needs\_VoiceFix\]**) |
| **Supports Self Determination Theory** | Guide language embeds autonomy, competence, and emotional safety through warm phrasing and gentle encouragement. |
| **Authenticity** | 10 points: Sounds like excellent real teacher throughout 8 points: Mostly natural with 1-2 scripted moments 6 points: Mix of natural and scripted 4 points: Mostly scripted with some natural moments 2 points: Entirely scripted/robotic |

All activity transitions and introductions must be warm, connective, and conceptually framed, acknowledging prior effort and previewing purpose. Avoid abrupt or generic phrasing. See *Script Writing Prompt* Transition Guidance.

### **🚫 Conversational Red Flags**

* Rhetorical or opt-out questions (“Want to try again?”)  
* Subversive prompts (“Let’s cut it wrong on purpose”)  
* Unnatural phrasing (e.g., “the split’s so good”) → **\[Needs\_VoiceFix\]**  
* Praise that permits disengagement (“Ready for a challenge?”)

## **✅ RUBRIC 3: BONUS FEATURES & SYSTEM LEVERAGE (Tag Only)**

| Tag | Use Case |
| ----- | ----- |
| **\[Curiosity\_Spark\]** | Builds interest or prediction |
| **\[Transfer\_Thinking\]** | Reinforces across visuals or concepts |
| **\[Identity\_Builder\]** | Strengthens math self-concept |
| **\[Emotional\_Pacing\]** | Supports stamina or energy variation |
| **\[System\_Leverage\]** | Uses profile data, remediation history, or system state to adapt prompt framing, visual scaffolding, or motivation. |
| **\[AI\_Peer\_Opportunity\]** | Prompts student to critique or support AI peer |
| **\[Wonder\_or\_Humor\]** | Encourages joy or novelty |
| **\[Interest\_Profile\_Opportunity\]** | Could personalize context |
| **\[Interest\_Profile\_Driven\]** | Directly uses student profile data |
| **\[Meta\_Remediation\]** | Supports retry after error |
| **\[Misconception\_Remediation\]** | Addresses known misconception types (e.g., “3 parts \= thirds”) |
| **\[Meta\_Prompt\]** | Promotes structured metacognition |
| **\[Gentle\_Encouragement\]** | Validates effort, especially post-remediation |
| **\[Mini\_Distraction?\]** | Mini behavior distracts from core task |
| **\[Autonomy\_Flag?\]** | Line is overly controlling |
| **\[Needs\_DevAdapt\]** | Requires developmental tuning |
| **\[Variant\_Use\]** | Uses appropriate \[Variant\_Use\] scaffolds to support developmental progression without cognitive overload. |
| **\[Recap\_Anchoring\]** | Recap lines that tightly reinforce prior concepts, highlight growth, and support cross-phase or cross-module transfer |

---

## **✅ STRUCTURE & TIMING CHECKLIST**

Scripts must:

* Include meaningful student interaction in all phases  
* Avoid disengagement invitations (e.g., “Want to keep going?”)  
* Stage vocabulary (concept before term)  
* Use remediation logic in Practice (Light → Medium → Heavy)  
* Ensure visual/metaphor continuity unless flagged  
* Introduce visuals only in Lesson phase (unless tagged \[Minimum\_Expectation?\])  
* Use directive, not optional phrasing (e.g., “Let’s try this…”)  
* Fraction coverage and symbolic integration match Full List tab and Visualization Specs  
* Warm-Up includes at least two: visual interest, judgment task, mini anchor, or real-world context  
* Tool naming, affordances, constraints, and misuse risks must match Visualization Specs. Any noncanonical use must be tagged \[Variant\_Use\] and documented.

If Spiral Tool Onboarding occurs (late path reroute to unfamiliar tool), follow Queue Rulebook spec: \[Tool\_Intro\] \+ review-level spiral task from original module \+ forward bridge to current module.

### **🔄 Phase Expectations**

| Phase | Requirements |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Warm-Up** | Must include at least one: narrative context, interest profile tie-in, student choice, or mini character involvement. 2+ visual interactions. No math terms. |
| **Lesson** | 2–3 interaction cycles per concept; includes modeling, scaffolding, remediation tiers, and symbolic connection. |
| **Practice** | 5–6 varied prompts; remediation logic; independent flow; visual variation; includes metacognitive and transfer momentsRemediation logic must follow Light → Medium → Heavy progression. Each tier must be warm, clear, scaffolded, and, where applicable, tagged with \[Misconception\_Remediation\] and \[Modeling\]. Heavy retries must include explicit modeling. |
| **Synthesis** | 4+ interactions; cross-visual or symbolic connection; reinforces or previews new idea |
| **Challenge** | No guide or minis; simulate test format |
| **Spiral Review** | 2–3 tasks; visual variation; reinforces flexible recall |
