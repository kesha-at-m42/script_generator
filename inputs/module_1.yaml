goals:
  - id: 1
    text: Understand that partitioning a shape into equal parts creates unit fractions
    content_categories:
      - parts
      - shapes
      - unit_fractions
    examples:
      - Divide a circle into 4 equal parts. What fraction is each part?
      - Show 1/4 on a number line from 0 to 1

  - id: 2
    text: Recognize that equal parts can be different shapes but same size
    content_categories:
      - shapes
      - equal_parts
    examples:
      - Compare two different ways to show halves of a rectangle
      - Which shapes show equal parts? Which do not?

  - id: 3
    text: Name unit fractions using fraction notation (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc.)
    content_categories:
      - notation
      - unit_fractions
    examples:
      - Write the fraction for one piece when a pizza is cut into 8 equal slices
      - What unit fraction represents one equal part of a shape divided into 6 parts?

misconceptions:
  - misconception: More pieces means bigger fractions
    correction: More pieces means smaller unit fractions (1/8 < 1/4)
  
  - misconception: All pieces must be the same shape to be equal
    correction: Pieces can be different shapes but same area/size
