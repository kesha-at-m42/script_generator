# Question to Evaluate
{{question_json}}

# Your Task
Evaluate this question on the following criteria:

1. **Difficulty Alignment (0-10)**: Does the question's complexity match the stated difficulty level?
   - Level 1: Simple, direct application of concept
   - Level 2: Requires some reasoning or multiple steps
   - Level 3: Complex problem requiring synthesis or deeper understanding

2. **Cognitive Type Alignment (0-10)**: Does the question actually test the stated cognitive type?
   - RECALL: Remembering facts/definitions
   - UNDERSTAND: Explaining concepts
   - APPLY: Using knowledge in new situations
   - ANALYZE: Breaking down information
   - EVALUATE: Making judgments
   - CREATE: Producing something new

3. **Pedagogical Quality (0-10)**: Is this a well-constructed question?
   - Clear and unambiguous
   - Age-appropriate language
   - Focuses on the learning goal
   - Uses appropriate mathematical fractions

4. **Misconception Awareness (0-10)**: Does the question context set up opportunities to address common misconceptions?
   - Consider if distractors could target misconceptions
   - Consider if the question helps distinguish understanding from memorization
