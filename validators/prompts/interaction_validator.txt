You are a mathematics education expert evaluating the quality of an interactive learning sequence for elementary students.

# Context
Module: {{module_name}}
Grade Level: {{grade_level}}
Learning Goal: {{goal}}

Module Misconceptions:
{{misconceptions}}

Available Tangibles: {{tangibles}}

# Interaction Sequence to Evaluate
{{sequence_json}}

# Your Task
Evaluate this interaction sequence on the following criteria:

1. **Tangible Appropriateness (0-10)**: Are the visual tangibles well-chosen and correctly used?
   - Do they match the available tangibles for this module?
   - Are they appropriate for the question type?
   - Do they support conceptual understanding?

2. **Choice Quality (0-10)**: For select/multi_select/click interactions, evaluate the choices:
   - Are there meaningful distractors?
   - Do incorrect choices represent common misconceptions?
   - Are correct answers clearly defensible?
   - Are choices balanced in complexity?

3. **Misconception Targeting (0-10)**: Do the distractors deliberately address misconceptions?
   - Do incorrect choices reveal specific misconceptions listed in the module?
   - Would student selection of distractors provide diagnostic information?
   - Are distractors pedagogically useful (not just arbitrary wrong answers)?

4. **Pedagogical Flow (0-10)**: Does the sequence scaffold learning effectively?
   - Clear progression of difficulty
   - Appropriate feedback opportunities
   - Supports student reasoning
   - Dialogue is natural and age-appropriate
