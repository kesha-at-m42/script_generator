"""
remediation_generator - AI Prompt

Generates incorrect validator states (L/M/H for Non-MC, per-distractor for
single-select MC, per-branch for multiselect MC) for each prompt in a lesson
section.

Runs in batch mode. Input is pre-filtered to sections that have at least one
prompt with a real validator (not any-response-advances).

Input per call: section JSON auto-wrapped as <input> by the pipeline.
Lesson context: the lesson_generator step output (lesson_sections.json) is passed
as <lesson_sections> by the pipeline so the generator can align correction language
with the lesson's teaching vocabulary and arc. Wired in lesson_generator_dialogue_pass
and exitcheck_generator_dialogue_pass via context_files.

Output per call:
  {
    "id": "<section_id>",
    "incorrects": [
      [ <incorrect_states_for_prompt_0> ],
      [ <incorrect_states_for_prompt_1> ],
      ...
    ]
  }
  One inner array per prompt in the section, in section order.
  Prompts with any-response-advances validators (single condition: {}) are
  skipped. No inner array emitted for them.

A downstream formatter (remediation_merger) inserts these states into the
correct validator arrays in the original section.

## TASK

The section to process is in `<input>`. Walk its `beats` array and find every `prompt` beat. For each prompt, generate the incorrect validator states. Output one inner array of states per prompt, in the order the prompts appear in the section.

**Skip any prompt whose `validator` is a single state with `condition: {}`** (any-response-advances). Emit nothing for it.

**Do NOT skip a `multiple_choice` prompt just because its validator only contains the correct state.** A `multiple_choice` validator that has only one `is_correct: true` state with `condition: { "selected": "..." }` means the wrong-answer states haven't been written yet — that is exactly what you are here to generate. The absence of pre-existing `is_correct: false` states is normal, not a signal to skip.

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

An array of arrays. One inner array per qualifying prompt, in section order:

```json
[
  [ <states for prompt 0> ],
  [ <states for prompt 1> ]
]
```

Each state follows the validator state schema:
```json
{
  "condition": { ... },
  "description": "...",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [ [ <beats> ] ]
}
```

`is_correct` must be `false` on every state you generate.

---

## STEP 1: DETECT QUESTION TYPE

For each qualifying prompt, check the `tool` field:

| `tool` | Track |
|---|---|
| `click_category`, `click_tangible`, `click_component`, or any workspace tool | **Non-MC** → Generic L-M-H |
| `multiple_choice` | **Single-Select MC** → Per-distractor Medium + Heavy |
| `multi_select` | **Multiselect MC** → Per-branch Medium + Heavy |

---

## STEP 2A: NON-MC: STATES

Follow `<remediation_design_ref>` Sections 2.4–2.5 for state structure and order. Always emit generic L/M/H after any specific-condition states. Follow length, visual, and language rules from `<remediation_design_ref>` Sections 4–6.

**Specific conditions** are pre-defined in the input. Inspect the existing `validator` for `is_correct: false` states with non-empty conditions (not just `{}`). Each such state has:
- `condition`: the base condition (e.g. `{ "container_count": 3 }`) — rewrite it into the `and`/`or` shape from the STATE ORDER section below
- `description`: a plain-English label for what wrong answer this represents
- `beats`: placeholder dialogue already written — use as inspiration when writing Medium-quality content (visual scaffold + 20–30 words)

For each specific condition, emit one state using the `and`/`or` condition shape from the STATE ORDER section below. Write or rewrite the dialogue and scene beats to Medium standard — do not just copy the placeholder beats verbatim.

**Two effective patterns for specific condition dialogue:**

- **Pattern A — Credit + narrow:** When the student got part right, acknowledge it, then narrow to the specific error. Close with a pointed question.
  > "You're right that there are 4 columns. But count how many dots are in each column. Are there 4?"

- **Pattern B — Name + redirect + point:** Name what the student did in one phrase, redirect to the correct concept, give one concrete action or question.
  > "You counted the Dogs. When we ask how many fewer, we need to find the difference. Count how far apart Dogs and Fish are."

In both patterns: the Medium answer rule applies — do not give the correct counts or values. The student still has to execute.

**Light** (`incorrect_count: 1`): dialogue only.
```json
{
  "condition": { "incorrect_count": 1 },
  "description": "Student answered incorrectly on first attempt",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [ { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." } ]
  ]
}
```

**Medium** (`incorrect_count: 2`): scene beat required. Dialogue teaches the method — name what to look at and in what order. Close with a pointed question or specific imperative.
```json
{
  "condition": { "incorrect_count": 2 },
  "description": "Student answered incorrectly on second attempt",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "update", "tangible_id": "...", "params": { "highlight_categories": ["..."] } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." }
    ]
  ]
}
```

**Heavy** (catch-all `{}`): `scene animate` beat required (system demonstrates the answer). Dialogue narrates the thinking, not just the mechanics — name the structure being demonstrated and connect each step to what it means. End with the underlying principle: why the answer has to be what it is, not just what the answer is. Take inspiration from the on_correct beat already in the section's validator — it names what was demonstrated for a student who got it right. The Heavy closing should echo that same structural insight, framed from the guide's perspective after modeling.
```json
{
  "condition": {},
  "description": "Student answered incorrectly three or more times. System models the answer.",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "animate", "tangible_id": "...",
        "params": { "event": "...", "status": "confirmed", "description": "..." } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." }
    ]
  ]
}
```

---

## STEP 2B: SINGLE-SELECT MC: PER-DISTRACTOR STATES

The correct option is in the correct state's `condition.selected`. All other values in `tool.options` are distractors.

**Derive distractors explicitly:** take the full `options` array and remove any value that appears as `condition.selected` in an `is_correct: true` validator state. Every remaining option is a distractor that requires a Medium state. Do this even if no `is_correct: false` states exist yet in the validator.

See `<remediation_design_ref>` Section 3.2 for Single-Select MC structure (no Light state; per-distractor Mediums + one Heavy).

One **Medium** per distractor: scene beat required. Dialogue names the error and redirects to the correct concept or tool. Close with a pointed question or specific imperative.
```json
{
  "condition": { "selected": <distractor> },
  "description": "Student selected <distractor>: <why this is wrong>",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "update", "tangible_id": "...", "params": { "highlight_categories": ["..."] } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." }
    ]
  ]
}
```

One **Heavy** (`condition: {}`): `scene animate` beat required.
```json
{
  "condition": {},
  "description": "Student answered incorrectly. System models the correct answer.",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "animate", "tangible_id": "...",
        "params": { "event": "...", "status": "confirmed", "description": "..." } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." }
    ]
  ]
}
```

---

## STEP 2C: MULTISELECT MC: PER-BRANCH STATES

Identify **correct answers** from the success/correct validator state condition — these are the values listed under `selected` clauses. **Incorrect answers** are values listed under `not_selected` clauses in that same condition.

**First, detect the no-wrong-options variant:** Count `not_selected` clauses in the correct validator condition. If there are **none**, all options are correct — no wrong options exist. Follow Section 3B.9 of `<remediation_design_ref>` and emit only Branch 2 + Heavy. Do NOT invent phantom wrong option values.

For the **no-wrong-options variant**, every possible error is an under-selecting error — so use `incorrect_count` conditions (same as Non-MC L/M/H). Do NOT use Branch 2/3/4 conditions.

**Light** (`incorrect_count: 1`) — dialogue only:
```json
{
  "condition": { "incorrect_count": 1 },
  "description": "Student has not selected all correct answers (first attempt)",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [ { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." } ]
  ]
}
```
Use a short nudge (10–20 words) pointing toward completeness — e.g. "Read the scenarios carefully. Did you select ALL?" Adapt to the content.

**Medium** (`incorrect_count: 2`) — scene beat required:
```json
{
  "condition": { "incorrect_count": 2 },
  "description": "Student has not selected all correct answers (second attempt)",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "update", "tangible_id": "...", "params": { "description": "..." } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." }
    ]
  ]
}
```

**Heavy** (`condition: {}`) — `scene animate` beat required. Models all correct answers.

For the **standard variant** (has at least one `not_selected` clause = has wrong options), identify all options not listed as `selected` in the correct condition as incorrect answers. See `<remediation_design_ref>` Section 3B for structure, branch definitions, language requirements, and condition patterns (no Light; Branches 2/3/4 Mediums + one Heavy).

One **Medium per branch**: scene beat required.
```json
{
  "condition": { <see Section 3B.7 for correct condition logic per branch> },
  "description": "Branch <N>: <description of student's selection state>",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "update", "tangible_id": "...", "params": { "highlight_categories": ["..."] } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." }
    ]
  ]
}
```

One **Heavy** (`condition: {}`): `scene animate` beat required. Shared fallback for all branches.
```json
{
  "condition": {},
  "description": "Student answered incorrectly. System models the correct answer.",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "animate", "tangible_id": "...",
        "params": { "event": "...", "status": "confirmed", "description": "..." } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." }
    ]
  ]
}
```

---

## STATE ORDER

**Non-MC inner array:**
1. One Medium per specific condition (if any) — `{ "and": [{ specific_condition }, { "or": [{"incorrect_count": 1}, {"incorrect_count": 2}] }] }`
2. Generic Light — `{ "and": [{"incorrect_count": 1}, {"not": { specific_condition }}, ...] }` (one `not` per specific condition)
3. Generic Medium — `{ "and": [{"incorrect_count": 2}, {"not": { specific_condition }}, ...] }` (one `not` per specific condition)
4. Generic Heavy (`condition: {}`): always last

**Single-Select MC inner array:**
1. One Medium per distractor (any order among themselves)
2. Heavy (`condition: {}`): always last

**Multiselect MC inner array (standard — has wrong options):**
1. Branch 2 Medium — under-selecting
2. Branch 3 Medium — all-wrong
3. Branch 4 Medium — mixed
4. Heavy (`condition: {}`): always last

**Multiselect MC inner array (no-wrong-options variant — zero `not_selected` in correct condition):**
1. Light — `{ "incorrect_count": 1 }` — dialogue only
2. Medium — `{ "incorrect_count": 2 }` — scene beat required
3. Heavy — `condition: {}` — always last

---

## LANGUAGE RULES

Follow all language patterns, word counts, visual requirements, and prohibited constructs from `<remediation_design_ref>` Sections 4–8 and 12.4.

**Light:** Use openers from Sections 4.1–4.2. Cycle — do not reuse the same phrase within a section.

**Medium:** Use a starter from Section 5.1. Cycle — do not reuse within a section.

**Medium — universal answer rule (applies to all tracks and specific conditions):** Never state the correct answer, value, or count in a Medium. This applies even when the answer is visible on screen (e.g. a key showing "Each ⭐ = 5", a label, a highlighted number). Redirect the student to the right place and let them read it. A Medium that names the answer removes the work the student needs to do. If you find yourself writing the correct value in a Medium, rewrite it as a question or imperative that sends the student to look.

**Heavy:** Use an opener from Section 6.1. Cycle — do not reuse within a section. End with closure per Section 7.

---

## SCOPE CONSTRAINTS

Use vocabulary naturally from <vocabulary>. Do not use phrases from <forbidden_phrases>. Do not reference concepts from <advanced_concepts>. Reference <required_phrases> in Medium/Heavy where genuinely appropriate. Ground explanations in <the_one_thing>. Keep tangible references consistent with the section's `scene` array and existing scene beats.

When <lesson_sections> is available, use it to align correction language with how the lesson taught the concept — match the vocabulary the guide used in earlier sections and frame corrections in terms the student has already encountered.

For prompts with `"variable_answer": true`: do not assume the student's specific attempt in Light or Medium dialogue. For Heavy, model one specific valid example but frame it as one way, not the only answer.

---

## OUTPUT RULES

- Output ONLY the `incorrects` array content. No explanation, no markdown fences.
- The prefill already opens `{"id": "...", "incorrects": [`. Complete from that point.
- Use double quotes throughout
- `is_correct: false` on every state
- Do not use em dashes (—) or double hyphens (--) in any text field; to create a pause or connect two thoughts, use a period or comma instead
