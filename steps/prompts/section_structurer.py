section_structurer - AI Prompt

Converts a structured spec (output of spec_parser) into section JSON objects
following the lesson script schema (sections / steps / beats).

Input is a flat JSON array of section objects, each with:
  - key-value fields extracted from the original markdown spec
  - workspace_specs: { toys: [...], tools: [...] } declaring what's on screen

Dialogue voice and enhancement are handled downstream by dialogue_rewriter.
This step focuses on structural correctness and faithful spec translation.

## TASK

<input> is a single structured section object produced by starterpack_parser.

It contains key-value fields extracted from the original spec
(visual, guide, prompt, correct_answer, on_correct, on_incorrect, purpose, etc.)
and a `workspace_specs` field: `{ "toys": ["picture_graph", "data_table"], "tools": ["click_category"] }`.

**Map all fields by meaning, not by name.** The input object may present
information in various field names and formats — interpret every field and
map it to the appropriate schema context:
- `student_action: "MC (2, 6, 8, 12)"` → `multiple_choice` prompt with
  options `[2, 6, 8, 12]`
- `student_action: "Multi-select: Dogs, Cats, Fish"` → `multi_select` with
  those options
- `guide_2`, `prompt_2`, `on_correct_2` etc. → a second step in the section
- `divider` fields are contextual labels only — they describe what is happening at that point in the spec. Do not use them to determine step boundaries and do not output them as beats. Use the surrounding prompt, student_action, and guide fields to determine structure.
- A `student_action` field that contains two actions joined by "and" (e.g. "selects X or Y and fills two number slots") represents two sequential prompts — split them into separate steps
- Inline annotations in any text field (e.g. `[System highlights rows
  sequentially]`, `[3 tile places into first slot]`) → `scene` beats at
  that point in the step
- `task` describing a build/click/drag action → infer the tool type from it
- Any beat in the outer `beats` array that only applies on a specific branch gets a `"branch_name": "<condition_id>"` field — referencing the `condition_id` of the validator state that established the branch (e.g. `"branch_name": "selected_rows"`). Omit the field when the beat is unconditional. When pushed to Notion, beats with the same `branch_name` are grouped under an H3 heading `🔀 <branch_name>`.
- **Once a branch is established, output ALL beats for one branch consecutively before writing ANY beat for the other branch.** Do not interleave. Wrong: rows-step-1, cols-step-1, rows-step-2. Correct: rows-step-1, rows-step-2 … then cols-step-1, cols-step-2. Complete one branch entirely, then the other.
- Fields whose value begins with a `[branch_name]` or `(qualifier)` prefix — e.g. `visual_2: "[selected_rows] Rows buttons activate."`, `on_correct_2: "(example: 4 × 5 = 20) \"4 times 5...\""` — carry inline context about which branch or condition the content belongs to. Strip the prefix when using the content; use `[branch_name]` values to assign `branch_name` to the corresponding beats, and use `(qualifier)` values to generate named validator states with `condition_id` matching the qualifier.

Do not ignore fields because their name is unfamiliar. Read every field in
the input object and decide where it belongs in the output structure.

**Canonical names:** `workspace_specs.toys` lists the only valid `tangible_type` values for this section.
`workspace_specs.tools` lists the only valid `tool` values. Use these exact strings verbatim — they have already been resolved to their canonical forms.

When `workspace_specs.tools` contains multiple tools, the section has multiple prompt beats — one per tool. Map each tool to the step it belongs to using the dividers and numbered fields as context.


Convert this section object into a single section JSON object following the lesson script schema.
Output only that one section object (not an array).

Scripts are static. Use concrete values throughout. Values are defined
in the spec. Do not invent values; do not use placeholders like [X].

**Dialogue:** carry the spec's dialogue intent directly into the text field.
Keep it clear and functional. Do not add warmth, personality, or flair.
A separate pass handles dialogue enhancement. Do not use em dashes (—).

Include all required phrases from <input>. Avoid all forbidden phrases.

---

## WHAT IS A STEP GROUP

A step group contains at most one prompt beat and at most one dialogue beat, and always ends with `current_scene`.

**Scene beats group with the dialogue they are tied to.** A scene beat either sets up the visual before the guide speaks, or fires immediately after the dialogue as the guide's words take visual effect on screen. Group them accordingly.

Valid step group compositions (scene beats may appear before dialogue, after dialogue, or both):
- Scene beat(s) → Dialogue → `current_scene`
- Scene beat(s) → Prompt → `current_scene`
- Scene beat(s) → Dialogue → Scene beat(s) → `current_scene`
- Scene beat(s) → Dialogue → Prompt → `current_scene`
- Scene beat(s) → Dialogue → Scene beat(s) → Prompt → `current_scene`

A `student_action` field that describes multiple interactions (e.g. "selects X, then presses button Y, then fills slot") means multiple step groups — one per interaction. Each step group ends with `current_scene`.

`current_scene` is always the last beat in every step group. All step groups are in the flat `beats` array — do not wrap them in a `steps` array.

---

## SECTION STRUCTURE

```json
{
  "id": "s{group}_{seq}_{slug}",
  "beats": [ ... ]
}
```

- `id`: copy verbatim from the input section's `id` field. Do not modify or re-derive it.
- `beats`: flat array of all beats for the entire section. Do **not** nest beats inside steps — put everything in one flat list.

Step groups are implicit: a new step begins after each `current_scene` beat. Every step group ends with a `current_scene` beat.

Every section begins with an empty screen. Everything visible must be put on screen explicitly by `scene` beats in the first step group. Nothing carries over from the previous section.

**Visual clearing phrases** — phrases like "Clean transition", "Practice clears", "Lesson graph clears", "Equation Builder clears", "Lesson visualization fades", and any similar `[thing] clears/fades` form in a `visual` field describe the empty starting state of the section, not an animation to generate. Do **not** create any `scene` or `animate` beat for these. The section already starts with an empty screen; these phrases confirm that and carry no actionable information.

**Transition sections** use `"type": "transition"` on the section object.
They have scene and dialogue beats. No prompts.

---

## BEAT TYPES

### Scene: things happen on screen

```json
{ "type": "scene", "method": "add", "tangible_id": "picture_graph_fruits", "tangible_type": "picture_graph",
  "params": { "mode": "reading", "orientation": "horizontal",
              "categories": ["Apples", "Bananas", "Oranges", "Grapes"],
              "description": "Horizontal picture graph appears. Favorite Fruits data. Each fruit symbol = 1 vote." } }
```
```json
{ "type": "scene", "method": "animate", "tangible_id": "bg_animals",
  "params": { "event": "draw_bar_guideline", "status": "confirmed",
              "description": "Horizontal line draws from top of Monkeys bar to vertical axis, 7 highlights" } }
```
```json
{ "type": "scene", "method": "update", "tangible_id": "bar_graph_colors",
  "params": { "highlight_categories": ["Blue", "Yellow"],
              "description": "Blue and Yellow bars highlight." } }
```

Methods: `add` `show` `hide` `animate` `update` `remove`

- Use **`add`** when a tangible appears for the first time. Always include
  `tangible_type` and a `params.description` of what the student sees.
  Include all relevant state fields in `params` (mode, orientation,
  categories, axis range, etc.) drawn from <toy_specs>.
- Use **`animate`** for named animation events: `event` (snake_case),
  `status` (`proposed` = setup in progress / `confirmed` = complete),
  `description` (plain English).
- Use **`update`** when a toy's state changes (highlighting, mode switch,
  template change, button state, expression value, etc.). Always include a
  `params.description` — plain English of what visually changes as a result.
- Use **`show`** / **`hide`** to toggle visibility of a tangible that
  already exists.

For the section-to-section transition (picture graph → bar graph), use
`animate` with `event: "transform_to_bar_graph"` on the picture graph
tangible, then treat subsequent sections as having the bar graph on screen.

### Dialogue: guide speaks

```json
{ "type": "dialogue", "text": "Every part of a graph has a job." }
```
```json
{ "type": "dialogue", "text": "The KEY shows the SCALE." }
```

Translate the spec's dialogue intent directly. Keep it clear and on-point.
Do not embellish. Voice enhancement happens in a later step.

### Prompt: student interacts

```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "Click on the category that got the MOST votes.",
  "tool": "click_category",
  "target": "picture_graph_fruits",
  "validator": [ ... ]
}
```

Every prompt requires `tool` and `validator`. The tangible in `target` must
already exist in the scene at this point in the step.

**Tool and target usage:**

| `tool` | `target` | `options` |
|---|---|---|
| `click_category` | tangible ID string | — |
| `click_component` | `"tangible_id.component"` string | — |
| `click_tangible` | array of IDs or `{ "type": "..." }` | — |
| `multiple_choice` | — | array of numbers or strings |
| `multi_select` | — | array of strings |

For all other tools (`place_tile`, `add_row`, `add_column`, `select_fill_option`, etc.) — refer to the **Canonical Tools** table in <glossary.md> for the correct `target` and validator condition shape.

`target` shapes:
- Single tangible: `"target": "picture_graph_fruits"`
- Specific component: `"target": "picture_graph_animals.key"`
- Multiple tangibles: `"target": ["pg_fruits", "pg_animals"]`
- All of a type: `"target": { "type": "picture_graph" }`

For `multiple_choice`, include the exact options from the spec:
`"tool": "multiple_choice", "options": [5, 6, 7, 8]`

For `multi_select`, include the category names:
`"tool": "multi_select", "options": ["Dogs", "Cats", "Fish", "Birds", "Lizards"]`

### current_scene: snapshot of the resulting scene

**Must be the last beat in every step** (and the last beat in every
validator state's inner step). It is a pure derived snapshot: reflect
only what `scene` beats have established. Tangibles carry forward
within a section — a tangible stays on screen until a `scene` beat
removes or hides it. Never introduce a tangible or state that no
`scene` beat has declared.

```json
{
  "type": "current_scene",
  "elements": [
    {
      "tangible_id": "picture_graph_fruits",
      "description": "Horizontal picture graph. Favorite Fruits data. Apples row highlighted. Data table alongside.",
      "tangible_type": "picture_graph",
      "mode": "reading",
      "orientation": "horizontal",
      "categories": ["Apples", "Bananas", "Oranges", "Grapes"]
    },
    {
      "tangible_id": "data_table",
      "description": "Data table showing Favorite Fruits values.",
      "tangible_type": "data_table"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each element includes:
- `tangible_id`: the instance ID
- `description`: plain English of what's visible and its current state
- `tangible_type`: canonical type from <toy_specs>
- Relevant state fields from <toy_specs> (mode, orientation, categories, etc.)

If the scene is empty at the end of a step, write `"elements": []`.

---

## VALIDATOR STRUCTURE

Define only the correct state. The remediation generator adds incorrect
states later. Always include `"is_correct": true` on every validator state
you generate.

Every validator state requires a `condition_id` — a short, semantic, stable
identifier (e.g. `"correct"`, `"selected_rows"`, `"placed_3x4"`). Use snake_case.

```json
"validator": [
  {
    "condition_id": "correct",
    "condition": { "selected": "Apples" },
    "description": "Student clicked Apples, correct, 6 votes",
    "is_correct": true,
    "beats": [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "animate", "tangible_id": "picture_graph_fruits",
        "params": { "event": "highlight_category", "status": "confirmed",
                    "description": "Apples row highlights to confirm selection.", "category": "Apples" } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "Apples got the most. 6 people chose it. You read that from the graph." }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Validator beats are feedback only.** They contain the immediate response to
the student's answer: a confirmation scene animation and/or dialogue. They do
NOT contain `current_scene`, do NOT set up the next step's scene, and do NOT
advance the interaction. After the validator fires, execution returns to the
outer beats and the next outer beat runs.

This means:
- Scene setup for the NEXT step goes in outer beats, not in validator beats.
- `current_scene` belongs in the outer beats array, not inside validators.
- Remediation (incorrect) states added later follow the same rule: feedback only.

**On-correct beats must only contain feedback directly about acknowledging
the correct answer.** Do not add beats that narrate the student's specific
path, set up the next scene, or make assumptions about what the student chose.

- For concrete answers (MC, click_category): name the answer.
  "Apples got the most votes: 6."
- For open-ended interactions (`variable_answer: true`): simple achievement
  acknowledgment only. Do not narrate the specific values the student may
  have used. "You got to 20."
- For branching or non-remediateable interactions where there is no meaningful
  feedback to give: use `{ "type": "empty" }` to signal intentional silence.
  Prefer this over an empty array.

**Flag variable-answer interactions.** When a prompt has no fixed correct
answer (`product_equals`, `sum_equals`, or any condition that does not check
a fixed `selected` value), add `"variable_answer": true` to the prompt beat.
This applies to all feedback for that prompt — on_correct and all remediation
states. Downstream steps use this flag to avoid generating language that
assumes a specific answer.

For `multiple_choice`: `{ "condition": { "selected": 7 } }`

For `multi_select` requiring multiple selections:
```json
{ "condition": { "and": [ { "selected": "Dogs" }, { "selected": "Fish" } ] } }
```

**Any-response-advances** (no wrong answer): `"condition": {}`

Use `"condition": {}` only when every response leads to the exact same next scene and step. If the choice determines what the student sees or does next, use a branching prompt instead (see **Branching prompts** above).

Use `condition` for answer-checking (one correct answer, remediation possible). Use `branch: true` for path-taking (both options valid, different beat sequences follow).

### Branching prompts

A **branching prompt** occurs when a student's choice leads to fundamentally
different sequences of interactions — only one path is followed, paths do not
reconverge. Both choices are valid; they lead to different beat sequences.

Use branching when the student picks between options and each choice leads to
different tools, different scene setup, or different follow-up prompts. Do NOT
use branching for standard correct/incorrect validation.

Set `"branching": true` on the prompt beat. Each validator state that
establishes a branch gets `"branch": true` and a short stable `condition_id`
(e.g. `"selected_rows"`, `"selected_columns"`). Both states have `"is_correct": true`.
Branch validator beats must not contain scene setup. Scene setup for each
branch goes in the outer beats with `branch_name`. Branch validator beats
may contain a dialogue beat acknowledging the choice, or `{ "type": "empty" }`
if there is nothing to say. No `current_scene`.

```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "Choose rows or columns.",
  "tool": "multiple_choice",
  "options": ["Rows", "Columns"],
  "branching": true,
  "validator": [
    {
      "condition_id": "selected_rows",
      "branch": true,
      "description": "Student chose rows",
      "is_correct": true,
      "beats": [ { "type": "empty" } ]
    },
    {
      "condition_id": "selected_columns",
      "branch": true,
      "description": "Student chose columns",
      "is_correct": true,
      "beats": [ { "type": "empty" } ]
    }
  ]
}
```

All outer beats that belong to a specific branch get `"branch_name": "<condition_id>"`.
Output ALL beats for one branch together before any beats for the other branch.
The unconditional `current_scene` right after the branching prompt captures
the pending-choice state; each branch's own `current_scene` carries `branch_name`.

```json
{ "type": "current_scene", "elements": [ ... ] },

{ "type": "scene", "method": "add", ..., "branch_name": "branch_a" },
{ "type": "prompt", ..., "branch_name": "branch_a",
  "validator": [ { "condition_id": "correct", "condition": { ... }, ... } ] },
{ "type": "current_scene", "elements": [ ... ], "branch_name": "branch_a" },

{ "type": "scene", "method": "add", ..., "branch_name": "branch_b" },
{ "type": "prompt", ..., "branch_name": "branch_b",
  "validator": [ { "condition_id": "correct", "condition": { ... }, ... } ] },
{ "type": "current_scene", "elements": [ ... ], "branch_name": "branch_b" }
```

---

## TWO-STEP INTERACTIONS

Two-step sections have two separate steps, each ending with `current_scene`
in the outer beats. Scene setup for step 2 goes in the outer beats after
step 1's `current_scene` — not inside step 1's validator.

```json
"beats": [
  { "type": "scene", "method": "update", "tangible_id": "bar_graph_colors",
    "params": { "highlight_categories": ["Yellow", "Red"] } },
  { "type": "dialogue", "text": "Step 1: Find how many chose Yellow or Red in all." },
  { "type": "prompt", "text": "How many liked Yellow or Red in all?",
    "tool": "multiple_choice", "options": [5, 6, 11, 14],
    "validator": [
      {
        "condition_id": "correct",
        "condition": { "selected": 11 },
        "description": "Student answered 11, correct",
        "is_correct": true,
        "beats": [
          { "type": "dialogue", "text": "11 in all. Yellow has 6, Red has 5. 6 plus 5 equals 11." }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  { "type": "current_scene", "elements": [ ... ] },
  { "type": "scene", "method": "update", "tangible_id": "bar_graph_colors",
    "params": { "highlight_categories": ["Green"], "description": "Green bar highlights for step 2." } },
  { "type": "dialogue", "text": "Step 2: Now compare that total to Green." },
  { "type": "prompt", "text": "How many MORE is 11 than Green's 4?",
    "tool": "multiple_choice", "options": [4, 7, 11, 15],
    "validator": [
      {
        "condition_id": "correct",
        "condition": { "selected": 7 },
        "description": "Student answered 7, correct",
        "is_correct": true,
        "beats": [
          { "type": "dialogue", "text": "7 more. You used TWO steps: first added, then compared." }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  { "type": "current_scene", "elements": [ ... ] }
]
```

## TANGIBLE IDs

| Visual described | ID convention | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Picture graph | `picture_graph_{slug}` | `picture_graph_fruits`, `picture_graph_animals`, `picture_graph_pets` |
| Bar graph | `bar_graph_{slug}` | `bar_graph_animals`, `bar_graph_books`, `bar_graph_colors` |
| Data table | `data_table` | `data_table` |

Use the same ID consistently. When the spec says "NEW graph," assign a new ID.
`tangible_type` must match the canonical name in <toy_specs> exactly.

---

## OUTPUT RULES

- Output ONLY valid JSON. No explanation, no markdown fences.
- Output a single section object starting with `{` and ending with `}`
- Use double quotes throughout
