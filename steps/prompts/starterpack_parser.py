starterpack_parser - AI Prompt

Converts a single pre-split spec section into a structured JSON object.
Runs in batch mode — one Claude call per section produced by spec_splitter.

Input (user message via batch):
    <input> - {index, major, minor, header, body} from spec_splitter

Output:
    Single JSON object with id + all extracted fields.

    role="""You are extracting structured fields from a single pre-split lesson spec section into a JSON object. Your job is precise extraction: pull every field from the body as written, faithfully and completely.""",

## TASK

<input> is a single spec section with these fields:
- `index`: position in the spec (ignore)
- `major`: major group number (e.g. 1, 2, 3) — use this exactly in the ID
- `minor`: sequential position within the major group — use this exactly in the ID
- `header`: the raw section header line (e.g. `### Interaction 1.1: Transition from Warmup`)
- `body`: the section's content

Your job:
1. Generate a `slug` from `header` — a short snake_case phrase capturing the section's purpose (3-5 words)
2. Extract every field from `body` using the field rules below
3. Return a single JSON object

The section ID must be: `s<major>_<minor>_<slug>` using the `major` and `minor` values from the input exactly as given.

## PARSING RULES

### Field extraction

Every line in the body following the pattern `**Label:** content` becomes a field.
The label (before the colon) is the field key, converted to snake_case.
The content (after the colon) is the field value as a string.

Common field mappings:
| Spec label | JSON key |
|---|---|
| Visual | `visual` |
| Guide | `guide` |
| Prompt | `prompt` |
| Task | `task` |
| Correct Answer | `correct_answer` |
| On Correct | `on_correct` |
| On Incorrect | `on_incorrect` |
| Purpose | `purpose` |
| Hook | `hook` |
| Engagement Anchor | `engagement_anchor` |
| Design Note | `design_note` |
| Scaffolding Note | `scaffolding_note` |
| Student Action | `student_action` |

If a label appears that is not in this table, still include it — use its snake_case form as the key. Do not drop any field from the body.

If the same label appears more than once, suffix each occurrence with `_1`, `_2`, `_3`, etc. (e.g. three `**Guide:**` fields become `guide_1`, `guide_2`, `guide_3`). Apply this to all repeated labels. Never silently overwrite a field — every occurrence must be preserved.

If a label contains parenthetical context — e.g. `**Correct Answer (if rows):**` or `**On Correct (if columns):**` — include the parenthetical in the key: `correct_answer_if_rows`, `on_correct_if_columns`. Labels with different parentheticals are distinct keys and do not get `_1`/`_2` suffixes.

### Prose between fields

Body sections sometimes contain plain sentences or bold step markers between key-value pairs (e.g. `**Step 1 — Specification:**` with no content after the colon, or a sentence like "Sequential enforcement same as 3.2/3.3."). These are not fields and not section boundaries. Capture them as `"divider": "..."` — one divider entry per run of such text. Do not let them interrupt field parsing or bleed into adjacent field values.

Any `**Label:** content` lines that follow a divider are still parsed as normal fields — the divider does not consume them. Only lines with no `**Label:** content` structure belong in the divider.

### Tables

If the body contains a table (e.g. Game Specifications), capture it as a nested object under the key derived from the table's heading label.

## OUTPUT RULES

- Output ONLY valid JSON. No explanation, no markdown fences.
- Return a single object starting with `{` and ending with `}`
- Use double quotes throughout
- Omit fields that are empty or not present in the body
- **Escape all double quotes inside string values** — if a field value contains a `"` character, it must be written as `\"` in the JSON string
