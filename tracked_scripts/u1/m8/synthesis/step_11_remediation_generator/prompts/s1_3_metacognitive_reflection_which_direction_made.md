## SECTION 1: System Architecture Overview

### 1.1 The Simplified Model

**v3 introduces a three-track approach based on question type:**

| Question Type | Remediation Approach | Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Non-MC with ambiguous errors** (create, shade, place, etc. — no specific wrong answers identified) | Generic L-M-H only | Error cause often ambiguous; tracking handles patterns |
| **Non-MC with specific errors** (same interaction types, but spec identifies one or more known wrong answers) | One Medium per specific condition + generic L-M-H for other answers | Spec identifies a known error (e.g. "reversed numbers") worth targeted feedback; see Section 2.5 |
| **Single-Select MC** (one correct answer) | Per-distractor branching | We know exactly which wrong answer; targeted feedback valuable |
| **Multiselect MC** ("select all that apply") | Per-branch Medium + single Heavy | Selection pattern reveals cognitive state; generic language stays scalable |

**Why This Works:**

- Non-MC errors are noisy. Kids click wrong for many reasons
- Single-Select MC distractors give clear diagnostic signal about thinking
- True misconceptions are caught by pattern tracking, not single-instance diagnosis
- Content volume becomes manageable without sacrificing quality

### 1.2 The Two Systems Working Together

```
IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK (This Document)
├── Non-MC (ambiguous errors): Generic L-M-H
│   └── Validators tag probable error type (for tracking only)
├── Non-MC (specific errors): One Medium per spec-defined condition + generic L-M-H for other answers
│   └── Spec identifies one or more known wrong-answer conditions; see Section 2.5
├── Single-Select MC: Per-distractor Medium + Heavy
│   └── Targeted feedback based on which wrong answer chosen
└── Multiselect MC: Per-branch Medium + Heavy
    └── Branch by selection pattern (under-select, all-wrong, mixed, or success)

PATTERN DETECTION (Background)
├── Rolling window tracks misconception indicators
├── Threshold triggers Intervention Activity
└── Intervention queued as next activity
```

### 1.3 Core Principles (Unchanged)

- **Sequential only:** Light → Medium → Heavy (max 3 attempts)
- **Never alternatives:** No "Try X or Y" or "Another way to think about it"
- **Progressive support:** Each level provides meaningfully more help
- **System takeover:** After Heavy, system moves student forward

### 1.4 What Changed from v2

| v2 (Old) | v3 (New) |
| :---- | :---- |
| Three remediation types at each level (Generic, Common Error, Misconception) | Non-MC: Generic only; Single-Select MC: Per-distractor; Multiselect MC: Per-branch |
| System detects error type and selects remediation in real-time | Non-MC: No detection needed; Single-Select MC: Distractor choice is the detection; Multiselect MC: Selection pattern is the detection |
| 9-15 remediation pieces per question | 3 pieces (Non-MC), 4-5 pieces (Single-Select MC), or 4 pieces (Multiselect MC) |
| Misconception addressed via targeted immediate feedback | Misconception addressed via Intervention after pattern detected |

## SECTION 2: Non-MC Remediation

### 2.1 Overview

For all non-multiple-choice interactions (shading, partitioning, placing on number lines, dragging, build-mode, etc.), the generic L-M-H is always present. **The validator still tags the probable error type** for misconception tracking, but the student receives generic feedback for any wrong answer — regardless of detected error type. Note: if more conditions are defined in the spec than have remediations designed, those conditions still fall through to the generic L-M-H.

When the spec identifies one or more specific known wrong-answer conditions, one targeted Medium per condition is added before the generic states. These specific condition states are a special case of the generic structure — see Section 2.5.

### 2.2 Why Generic Works

- Single errors are noisy. We can't reliably diagnose from one mistake
- Pattern detection across multiple opportunities is more accurate
- Reduces content creation burden dramatically
- Interventions (when triggered) provide better conceptual support than in-the-moment micro-corrections

### 2.3 Non-MC Flow

```
Student attempts → Wrong
    ↓
Light Remediation (generic)
    ↓
Student attempts → Wrong
    ↓
Medium Remediation (generic) + Visual scaffold
    ↓
Student attempts → Wrong
    ↓
Heavy Remediation (generic) + Full modeling → Reveals answer
    ↓
System moves forward

[Background: Validator logs probable error type for tracking]
```

### 2.4 Generic Non-MC Structure

**Light (10-20 words):** Brief redirect, no visual.

**Medium (20-30 words):** Visual scaffold required. Teach the method — name what to look at and in what order — without supplying the specific counts or values. The student still has to do the work. Close with a pointed question or specific imperative that sends the student back to the problem.

**Heavy (30-60 words):** Full modeling with \[Modeling\] tag. Narrate the thinking, not just the mechanics — name the structure being demonstrated, connect each step to what it means. End with the underlying principle: why the answer has to be what it is, not just what the answer is.

### 2.5 Specific Conditions (special case)

Some Non-MC prompts have specific wrong-answer conditions identified in the spec (e.g. "student reverses the two numbers"). There may be one or more such conditions.

**One Medium per identified condition.** Each condition gets one state, written at Medium level (visual scaffold + 20–30 words of dialogue). It fires on either the first or second attempt when that specific wrong answer is given. The generic L-M-H remains — it covers all other wrong answers, and covers the specific conditions on attempt 3+.

**State order when specific conditions are present:**

1. One Medium per specific condition — fires on attempt 1 or 2 when that specific wrong answer is given
2. Generic Light — attempt 1, wrong answer that did not match a specific condition
3. Generic Medium — attempt 2, wrong answer that did not match a specific condition
4. Generic Heavy — system models the correct answer. Always last. Also fires for specific conditions on attempt 3+.

### Writing specific condition dialogue

Two patterns work well for specific condition mediums:

**Pattern A — Credit + narrow:** When the student got part of the answer right, acknowledge it, then narrow to the specific thing that was wrong. Close with a pointed question.

> "You're right that there are 4 columns. But count how many dots are in each column. Are there 4?"

Structure: `[What was right]. [But/Now] [what to re-examine]. [Pointed question or one step.]`

**Pattern B — Name + redirect + point:** Name what the student did briefly, redirect to the correct concept, give one concrete action or question.

> "You counted the Dogs. When we ask how many fewer, we need to find the difference. Count how far apart Dogs and Fish are."

Structure: `[What they did — one phrase]. [What the question actually needs]. [One action or question.]`

In both patterns: do not give the correct counts or values. The student still has to look and execute. The medium names the error and points the way — it does not complete the work.

**Rules:**
- Each specific condition is ONE state covering attempt 1 or 2. Do not write separate states per attempt.
- Generic L-M-H states are always required even when specific conditions are present.
- Specific condition states are Non-MC only. Single-Select MC and Multiselect MC use per-distractor/per-branch logic instead.

---

## SECTION 3: Single-Select MC Remediation (Per-Distractor Branching)

### 3.1 Overview

For single-select multiple choice questions, we know exactly which wrong answer the student chose. Each distractor represents a specific error or misconception, so we can provide **targeted feedback**.

### 3.2 Single-Select MC Structure

For a 4-option Single-Select MC question (1 correct \+ 3 distractors):

- **3 Medium remediations** (one per distractor)
- **1 Heavy remediation** (explains the correct answer)

**No Light remediation for Single-Select MC.** Rationale: If they knew the right answer, they would have picked it. A generic "check your answer" rarely helps when we have specific diagnostic information.

### 3.3 Single-Select MC Flow

```
Student selects Distractor A → Wrong
    ↓
Medium A (targeted to Distractor A's error) + Visual scaffold
    ↓
Student selects Distractor B → Wrong
    ↓
Medium B (targeted to Distractor B's error) + Visual scaffold
    ↓
Student selects any wrong answer → Wrong
    ↓
Heavy (explains correct answer) + Full modeling
    ↓
System moves forward
```

**Same distractor twice:** Student receives the same Medium again. This provides reinforcement and removes any gaming incentive (no shortcut to Heavy/completion).

### 3.4 Single-Select MC Distractor Design Principles

Each distractor should represent a **diagnosable error:**

| Distractor Type | Example | Medium Focus |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Numerator/denominator confusion | Selected 4/3 instead of 3/4 | "The numerator tells us how many parts we have, not the total" |
| Counted total instead of shaded | Selected 6/6 when 4/6 shaded | "Count only the shaded parts for the numerator" |
| Ignored equal parts requirement | Selected unequal partition | "For fractions, all parts must be equal size" |
| Whole number thinking | Selected 3 instead of 3/4 | "We need a fraction. The bottom number tells us the size of parts" |

### 3.5 Metacognitive Single-Select MC Questions

Metacognitive questions ("Which strategy would help?", "What should you check first?") are **highest value for branching**. Each wrong strategy choice reveals specific thinking patterns we can address.

---

## SECTION 3B: Multiselect MC Remediation (Per-Branch Branching)

### 3B.1 Overview

For "select all that apply" questions, students may select multiple answers simultaneously. The error signal is not a single distractor but a **selection pattern** — which correct and incorrect options were included in the submission. Branching is based on that pattern rather than on a specific choice.

### 3B.2 Multiselect MC Structure

Before generating remediation, identify whether the question has wrong options:

**Signal — check whether the question has any wrong options:**
- If some options are ones the student should **not** select → **standard variant** (some options are wrong)
- If every option is a valid correct answer → **no-wrong-options variant** (see Section 3B.9)

**Standard variant** (has wrong options):

- **3 Medium remediations** (one per error branch)
- **1 Heavy remediation** (explains the full correct selection)

**No Light remediation for standard Multiselect MC.** Same rationale as Single-Select MC: a generic "check your answer" provides little help when the selection pattern gives specific diagnostic information.

**No-wrong-options variant:** See Section 3B.9.

### 3B.3 The Four Branches

| Branch | Condition | Remediation | Tone |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Branch 1** | All correct answers selected, no incorrect | Success path | — |
| **Branch 2** | Only correct answers selected, but not all | Medium 2 — under-selecting | Near-success: acknowledge what they got right; nudge toward the rest |
| **Branch 3** | All incorrect answers selected, none correct | Medium 3 — all-wrong | Foundational: redirect to the concept before re-attempting; do not acknowledge selections positively |
| **Branch 4** | Mix of correct and incorrect selected | Medium 4 — over-selecting | Acknowledge the correct picks genuinely; clearly flag that one or more choices don't fit |

**Pedagogical principle:** Tone must reflect how close the student actually is to the correct answer. Branch 2 is a near-success — every selection was valid, the student just stopped short — and deserves meaningfully more positive framing than Branch 3, where no correct answers were identified. Remediation language should never feel uniform across branches; each branch represents a meaningfully different cognitive state.

### 3B.4 Multiselect MC Flow

```
Student submits selection
    ↓
Branch 1: All correct → Success
Branch 2: Correct-only, incomplete → Medium 2 + Visual scaffold
Branch 3: All incorrect → Medium 3 + Visual scaffold
Branch 4: Mixed correct + incorrect → Medium 4 + Visual scaffold
    ↓
Student submits again
    ↓
Same branch → Same Medium repeated (reinforcement; removes gaming incentive)
Different branch → That branch's Medium
    ↓
Student submits again (3rd attempt)
    ↓
Heavy (all branches share one Heavy) + Full modeling → Reveals correct answer
    ↓
System moves forward
```

**Same branch twice:** Student receives the same Medium again. This provides reinforcement and removes any gaming incentive, consistent with Single-Select MC logic.

### 3B.5 Generic Language Requirement

Multiselect MC Mediums use **generic language across all submissions in a given branch** — no per-combination branching. This is a deliberate architectural constraint, not an oversight.

**The under-selecting case is where this is most tempting to violate.** When the correct answers are {A, B} and a student selects only A, it is natural to want to say "You got A — now find the other one." When a student selects only B, it is natural to say "You got B — now find the other one." But these are the same cognitive state (correct so far, incomplete) and must receive the same generic Medium. Do not enumerate partial-correct combinations, even when there are only two correct answers.

**Why:** With N correct answers, the number of partial-correct combinations is 2ᴺ − 2. With 2 correct answers that is 2 variants; with 3 it is 6; with 4 it is 14. Per-combination branching is unscalable, and the combinations do not represent meaningfully different cognitive states — they represent the same state (under-selecting) reached via different paths.

A student who selected only {A} and a student who selected only {A, B} (when correct answers are {A, B, C}) both receive Branch 2 Medium. The Medium acknowledges that their selections were valid but incomplete and prompts them to look for more — without referencing which specific answers they chose.

### 3B.6 Branch 3 Tone Distinction

Branch 3 (all-wrong) must be **distinctly more foundational in tone** than Branches 2 and 4. All-wrong signals a deeper conceptual gap — the student has not identified any correct answers. Branch 3 Medium should redirect the student to what the concept means before they attempt again. Do not frame this as "close" or acknowledge the selections positively in any way.

### 3B.7 Branch Condition Patterns

Each branch must be expressed as a self-sufficient condition — do not rely on evaluation order to exclude cases that the condition itself does not rule out. The correct patterns, where `[C...]` are correct answer values and `[W...]` are incorrect answer values:

| Branch | Condition logic |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Branch 2** (under-selecting) | (any correct selected) AND NOT (all correct selected) AND NOT (any incorrect selected) |
| **Branch 3** (all-wrong) | NOT (any correct selected) |
| **Branch 4** (mixed) | (any incorrect selected) AND (any correct selected) |
| **Heavy** | `{}` — unconditional fallback |

**Branch 2 must explicitly exclude incorrect selections.** Without that clause, a student who selects one correct answer plus one incorrect answer will be caught by Branch 2 (under-selecting) instead of Branch 4 (mixed). This is the most common condition bug for multiselect questions.

**Branch 4 must explicitly require at least one correct selection.** Without that clause, the condition overlaps with Branch 3. The overlap is masked by evaluation order but makes the condition's intent ambiguous and fragile.

### 3B.9 No-Wrong-Options Variant

Some Multiselect MC prompts have **no incorrect options** — every option in the list is a valid correct answer.

In this case, Branch 3 (all-wrong) and Branch 4 (mixed correct + incorrect) are **structurally impossible**. The student can only under-select or select all.

**Detection:** If every option in the question is a correct answer, this is the no-wrong-options variant.

#### Why specific remediations still matter here

Even though there are no wrong options, targeted remediations are valuable when the spec or content gives us confidence about which options students commonly miss. A student who recognizes two out of three valid scenarios has made real progress — generic "you missed some" language fails to credit that and misses the chance to point them toward the specific gap.

When the likely missing option is predictable (e.g. a less obvious scenario, a counter-intuitive case), a targeted Medium pointing toward that option gives meaningfully more help than a generic nudge. This follows the same logic as Non-MC specific conditions (Section 2.5): where we can identify the error pattern with confidence, we write for it.

#### Positive reinforcement requirement

Because every option the student selected is correct, remediation language at Light and Medium level **must acknowledge what they got right**. The student has made no errors — they have only stopped short. Tone should be genuinely near-success, not corrective.

- Do not say "Not quite" or "Let's try again" — those signal an error that isn't there
- Do say "You found some — are there any others?" or "Those are all correct. Did you select ALL?"

#### Structure

**Generic (no predictable missing option):** Use attempt-count conditions — the same L/M/H pattern as Non-MC.

- **Light (first attempt):** Short nudge with positive framing, no scene beat. Example: "Those are correct — did you select ALL of them?"
- **Medium (second attempt):** Acknowledge correct selections, then guide toward what's missing with a visual scaffold (20–30 words).
- **Heavy (final attempt):** Models all correct answers. Full modeling demonstration required.

**Specific (commonly missed option known):** Add one targeted Medium per predictable gap before the generic states, following the same order as Non-MC specific conditions (Section 2.5). Generic L/M/H remains — it covers all other under-selecting patterns and covers specific gaps on the final attempt.

**Do not invent phantom wrong options.** If every option is correct, emit L/M/H by attempt count — not Branch 2/3/4.

---

### 3B.8 Heavy for Multiselect MC

All branches escalate to the same single Heavy on the final attempt. Heavy for Multiselect MC:

- Explains which answers are correct and why
- Demonstrates the full correct selection with \[Modeling\] tag
- Reveals the answer explicitly
- Does not reference the student's specific wrong submission

After Heavy, the system moves the student forward regardless of response.

```
[Heavy_Remediation] [Meta_Remediation] [Modeling]: "[30-60 words explaining the correct selections and demonstrating the reasoning]"
[Visual: Correct answers highlighted; system demonstrates selection process]
Guide: "[Post-modeling acknowledgment]"
```

---

## SECTION 4: Light Remediation Language Patterns

**Length:** 10-20 words
**Tone:** Brief and direct
**Visual:** None
**Applies to:** Non-MC interactions only (Single-Select MC and Multiselect MC both skip Light)

### 4.1 With Error Signal (40-50% of interactions)

Use at beginning of module, after successes, when student might think they're right:

- "Not quite. \[specific guidance\]"
- "Almost. \[specific guidance\]"
- "Let's try again. \[specific guidance\]"
- "Let's look at this problem again."
- "Let's take another look."
- "Let's try that again."
- "Let's look closely: \[specific guidance\]"

### 4.2 Without Error Signal (50-60% of interactions)

Use mid-module, when error is obvious, to avoid repetition:

- Direct guidance with no preamble
- "Check \[specific element\]"
- "Count \[specific element\]"
- "Focus on \[specific element\]"
- Simple imperative statements

### 4.3 Guidance Alternatives to "Remember"

Save "Remember" for Medium/Heavy. At Light level, use:

- "The key is..."
- "Focus on..."
- "Notice that..."
- "Here's what helps..."
- "Check the..."

### 4.4 Light Examples

- "Not quite. Count the shaded parts only."
- "Check the spacing between marks."
- "Focus on equal-sized parts."
- "Let's look closely: which parts are shaded?"
- "Count from zero, not from one."

---

## SECTION 5: Medium Remediation Language Patterns

**Length:** 20-30 words
**Tone:** Acknowledge struggle, collaborative
**Visual:** REQUIRED (from Visual Scaffolds TSV)
**Applies to:** Non-MC, Single-Select MC, and Multiselect MC

### 5.1 Approved Starters (Non-MC)

- "Let's think about this together. \[specific help\]"
- "Here's a hint: \[specific clue\]"
- "You're working on it. Here's what helps: \[specific support\]"
- "You're getting there. The key is \[crucial detail\]"
- "Let's think about this a bit more. \[guidance\]"

### 5.2 Closing with a Call to Action

Every medium closes with a call to action that sends the student back to attempt. Use a pointed question or a specific imperative — concrete enough that the student knows exactly where to look or what to do next.

Effective CTAs:
- "How many rows do you see?"
- "Count those and place the numbers."
- "Place those numbers into the expression."
- "Does it change?"

The starter establishes the redirect; the CTA makes it actionable.

### 5.2 Single-Select MC Medium Structure

For Single-Select MC, Medium is targeted to the specific distractor chosen:

**Template:**

```
[Medium_Remediation - Distractor_A] [Meta_Remediation]: "[20-30 words addressing why Distractor A is wrong and redirecting thinking]"
[Visual: Scaffold highlighting the specific error]
```

**Example (student chose 6/6 when 4/6 was shaded):**

```
[Medium_Remediation - Distractor_B] [Meta_Remediation]: "You counted all the parts. The numerator only counts the shaded parts. How many are filled in?"
[Visual: Shaded parts pulse/highlight, unshaded parts dim]
```

### 5.3 Medium Examples (Non-MC)

- "Let's think about this together. Four fourths equals 1, then three more fourths gets us to 7/4." \[Visual: Number line with 4/4 marked at 1\]
- "Here's a hint: each fourth stays the same size, even past 1." \[Visual: Equal jumps highlighted\]
- "You're working on it. Count the shaded parts for the top number." \[Visual: Shaded sections pulse\]

### 5.4 "Remember" Usage

- Maximum 2-3 times per entire module
- Medium/Heavy only (never Light)
- Use for genuinely important callbacks to prior learning

---

## SECTION 6: Heavy Remediation Language Patterns

**Length:** 30-60 words
**Tone:** Full support, complete demonstration
**Visual:** REQUIRED (full modeling demonstration)
**Tag:** \[Modeling\] REQUIRED
**Closure:** REQUIRED — dialogue ends with a statement that names the correct answer and the concept the question was testing (see Section 7)
**Applies to:** Non-MC, Single-Select MC, and Multiselect MC

### 6.1 Approved Opening Language

- "This one takes a bit of thought, so let's work through it together..."
- "Let me show you how this works."
- "Here, let me walk you through this one."
- "Let's work through this step by step..."
- "These can be challenging. Let me show you..."
- "Let me help a bit more."
- "This one needs a closer look, so let's do it together."

### 6.2 Heavy Structure (Non-MC)

```
[Heavy_Remediation] [Meta_Remediation] [Modeling]: "[30-60 words with complete step-by-step demonstration, ending with closure: name the correct answer and the concept it demonstrates]"
[Visual: System demonstrates complete solution]
```

### 6.3 Heavy Structure (Single-Select MC)

For Single-Select MC, Heavy explains why the correct answer is right:

```
[Heavy_Remediation] [Meta_Remediation] [Modeling]: "[30-60 words explaining the correct answer and demonstrating the thinking, ending with closure: name the correct answer and the concept it demonstrates]"
[Visual: Correct answer highlighted with supporting scaffold]
```

### 6.4 Heavy Examples

**Non-MC:** "Let me show you how this works. First, I count the total parts. That's my denominator: 4\. Then I count just the shaded parts. That's my numerator: 3\. So the fraction is 3/4." \[Visual: System highlights total parts, then shaded parts, then shows 3/4\]

**Single-Select MC:** "Let me show you how to think about this. The question asks which fraction is shown. I count 4 equal parts total. That's the denominator. 3 parts are shaded. That's the numerator. So the answer is 3/4, not 4/3." \[Visual: Correct answer highlighted, visual shows counting sequence\]

---

## SECTION 7: Post-Modeling Closure

Heavy is the final state for a question. There is no student call-to-action after Heavy — the system moves the student forward automatically. The closing line of the Heavy dialogue must provide **closure**: a statement that names the correct answer and the concept the question was testing.

This is the same function that on_correct feedback serves when a student answers correctly. After being shown the answer, the student should leave knowing what the answer was and why it is correct.

### 7.1 Closure Structure

The Heavy dialogue ends with a closure sentence that:

- Names the correct answer explicitly in the context of the question
- States the underlying concept briefly (the "so what")
- Does not ask the student to do anything

**Pattern:** `[Modeling narration ends.] [Correct answer stated in context.] [Brief concept restatement.]`

### 7.2 Closure Examples

**Non-MC (fraction shading):** "...I count the total parts. That is my denominator: 4. I count the shaded parts. That is my numerator: 3. The fraction shown is 3/4."

**Single-Select MC:** "...The denominator is 4, the numerator is 3. The answer is 3/4, not 4/3. The numerator counts the shaded parts, not the total."

**Multiselect MC:** "...Both A and C show equal parts of a whole. Those are the fractions. That is what makes something a fraction — equal parts with a count."

### 7.3 NEVER Use as the Closing Line

- ❌ "See how that works?" — does not name the answer
- ❌ "There we go." — does not name the answer
- ❌ "Now you understand." — does not name the answer
- ❌ "Perfect\!" (they didn't do it alone)
- ❌ "You figured it out\!" (guide showed them)
- ❌ "Great job\!" (too independent)
- ❌ "Excellent work\!" (overpraises assisted work)

### 7.4 Forward Move (Optional)

A brief forward phrase may follow the closure line but is not required:

- "Now let's continue."
- "Let's keep going."

Do not use "Let's try another one." — it implies an immediate retry of the same problem, which does not reflect system behavior after Heavy.

---

## SECTION 8: Error Signal Strategy

### 8.1 When to Use Error Signals

Use error signals (40-50% of Light remediations) when:

- Beginning of module (establish pattern)
- After successes (clear change signal)
- When student might think they're right
- Ambiguous errors

### 8.2 When to Skip Error Signals

Skip error signals (50-60% of Light remediations) when:

- Error is obvious
- Would cause repetition
- Mid-module routine corrections
- Guidance itself implies error

### 8.3 Variety Requirement

Never repeat the same error signal phrase within 3 interactions. Rotate through:

- "Not quite."
- "Almost."
- "Let's try again."
- "Let's look at this problem again."
- "Let's take another look."

---

## SECTION 9: Misconception Tracking & Intervention Triggers

### 9.1 How Tracking Works

Even though non-MC remediation is generic, **validators tag the probable error type** for every wrong answer. This feeds the misconception tracking system.

```
Student makes error → Generic remediation served
                   → Validator logs: "Probable Misconception #3"
                   → Running count updated

[After phase transition]
System checks: Has any misconception hit threshold?
    YES → Queue Intervention Activity
    NO → Continue normal flow
```

### 9.2 Tracking Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Trigger threshold** | 5 errors (placeholder) | TBD with data |
| **Rolling window** | Last 20 opportunities | Natural decay mechanism |
| **Window spans** | Lesson, Exit Check, Practice, Spiral Review, Test Prep | Cross-activity tracking |
| **Check timing** | Phase transitions | Engineer to confirm feasibility |
| **Post-Intervention threshold** | Window lowers to 15 | Catches continued struggle faster |

### 9.3 What Gets Tracked

**Tracked (feeds Intervention triggers):**

- Misconception indicators (\#1-\#10)
- Tracked per visual type for accuracy
- Combined at misconception level for Intervention trigger

**Not Tracked for Intervention:**

- Common procedural errors (counting mistakes, off-by-one)
- Random/ambiguous errors

### 9.4 Example Tracking Flow

```
Opportunity 1: Error on Rectangle Bar → Validator: Misconception #3 → Count: 1
Opportunity 5: Error on Number Line → Validator: Misconception #3 → Count: 2
Opportunity 9: Error on Rectangle Bar → Validator: Misconception #3 → Count: 3
Opportunity 14: Error on Grid → Validator: Misconception #3 → Count: 4
Opportunity 18: Error on Rectangle Bar → Validator: Misconception #3 → Count: 5 ← THRESHOLD

[At next phase transition]
→ Misconception #3 Intervention queued as next activity
```

---

## SECTION 10: Intervention Activity Overview

### 10.1 What Interventions Are

Intervention Activities are **standalone instructional sequences** that address a specific misconception directly. They sit outside regular modules and slot into the activity queue when triggered.

### 10.2 Intervention Scope

- **\~10 total** (one per misconception)
- **Combines visuals** (not visual-specific)
- **Path-flexible** (may use visuals from multiple paths with worked examples)

### 10.3 Intervention Structure

| Phase | Name | Purpose | Approach |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | **Clarify** | Name the misconception | Metacognitive: "A lot of students think X. Let's look at why that's hard to see..." |
| 2 | **Model** | Worked examples | Guide demonstrates across 2-3 examples using multiple visuals |
| 3 | **Confirm** | Independent verification | 2-3 problems student completes independently |

### 10.4 Queue Placement

- Intervention replaces whatever activity would have been next
- Multiple triggers \= multiple Interventions queued with brain breaks between
- Follows existing recess/break logic in Activity Queue

### 10.5 After Intervention

- Rolling window lowers to 15 (from 20\)
- If misconception continues to appear, re-triggers faster
- Alternative: Queue targeted Practice problems before re-triggering full Intervention

## SECTION 11: Remediation by Phase

### 11.1 Requirements by Phase

| Phase | Non-MC Requirement | Single-Select MC Requirement | Multiselect MC Requirement | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Warmup | Light minimum | Per-distractor Medium \+ Heavy | Per-branch Medium \+ Heavy | Heavy if key prior knowledge |
| Lesson | Full L-M-H | Per-distractor Medium \+ Heavy | Per-branch Medium \+ Heavy | All interactions |
| Exit Check | Full L-M-H | Per-distractor Medium \+ Heavy | Per-branch Medium \+ Heavy | MANDATORY \- gateway phase |
| Practice | Full L-M-H | Per-distractor Medium \+ Heavy | Per-branch Medium \+ Heavy | Light only for confidence builders |
| Synthesis | Light minimum | Per-distractor Medium \+ Heavy | Per-branch Medium \+ Heavy | Full L-M-H for pattern discovery |
| Challenge | None | None | None | Assessment mode |

### 11.2 Module Complexity Considerations

**Modules 1-3 (Simple concepts):**

- Light remediation may be sufficient for some interactions
- Simpler language appropriate
- Don't force full L-M-H if unnecessary

**Modules 4-8 (Building complexity):**

- Full L-M-H progression more common
- Can reference earlier module strategies

**Modules 9-12 (Complex concepts):**

- Full L-M-H usually needed
- More nuanced explanations appropriate

**Documentation:** Use \[Pedagogical\_Override\] when reality differs from stated requirements.

---

## SECTION 12: Quality Checklist

### 12.1 Non-MC Remediation Checklist

**Track A (ambiguous errors — no specific conditions):**
- [ ] Generic L-M-H only (no branching by error type)
- [ ] Light: 10-20 words, no visual
- [ ] Medium: 20-30 words, visual REQUIRED
- [ ] Heavy: 30-60 words, \[Modeling\] tag REQUIRED, visual REQUIRED
- [ ] Heavy dialogue ends with closure: names the correct answer and the concept it demonstrates
- [ ] Different language at each level
- [ ] No independent-success praise after modeling
- [ ] Validator tags probable error type (noted in script or separate)

**Track B (specific errors — spec defines known wrong answers):**
- [ ] One state per specific condition using `and`/`or` condition: `{ "and": [{ condition }, { "or": [{"incorrect_count":1},{"incorrect_count":2}] }] }`, Medium level, visual REQUIRED
- [ ] Generic Light (`incorrect_count: 1`) after all specific-condition states
- [ ] Generic Medium (`incorrect_count: 2`), visual REQUIRED
- [ ] Generic Heavy (`condition: {}`), \[Modeling\] tag REQUIRED, visual REQUIRED
- [ ] Heavy dialogue ends with closure: names the correct answer and the concept it demonstrates

### 12.2 Single-Select MC Remediation Checklist

- [ ] One Medium per distractor (3 distractors \= 3 Mediums)
- [ ] Each Medium targets specific error that distractor represents
- [ ] One Heavy explaining correct answer
- [ ] All Mediums have visual scaffolds
- [ ] Heavy has \[Modeling\] tag
- [ ] No Light remediation (Single-Select MC skips to Medium)

### 12.2B Multiselect MC Remediation Checklist

- [ ] Three Medium remediations — one per error branch (under-selecting, all-wrong, mixed)
- [ ] Branch 2 Medium (under-selecting) acknowledges correct picks and nudges toward missing answers — near-success tone
- [ ] Branch 3 Medium (all-wrong) redirects to the concept without positively acknowledging selections — foundational tone, distinctly more remedial than Branches 2 and 4
- [ ] Branch 4 Medium (mixed) acknowledges correct picks genuinely and clearly flags what doesn't fit
- [ ] All three Mediums use generic language — no per-combination branching
- [ ] One Heavy explaining the full correct selection with \[Modeling\] tag
- [ ] All Mediums have visual scaffolds
- [ ] No Light remediation (Multiselect MC skips to Medium)
- [ ] Tone varies meaningfully across branches — remediation language does not feel uniform

### 12.3 Variety Checklist (Per Module)

- [ ] Minimum 8 different Light patterns (non-MC)
- [ ] 4-5 different Medium approaches
- [ ] "Remember" maximum 2-3 times total
- [ ] No exact phrase repeated within 3 problems
- [ ] Error signals rotated (40-50% with signal)

### 12.4 Structure Violations (Never Include)

- ❌ Alternative paths ("Try X or Y")
- ❌ Light remediation that teaches new content
- ❌ Medium without visual scaffold
- ❌ Heavy without \[Modeling\] tag
- ❌ Independent success praise after modeling
- ❌ More than 3 attempts before system takeover

## APPENDIX: Misconception Reference

### Full Misconception List

| ID | Misconception | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| \#1 | Unequal parts acceptable | Believes fractions don't require equal-sized parts |
| \#2 | Numerator \= total parts | Confuses numerator with denominator |
| \#3 | Fractions aren't numbers | Sees fractions as two separate numbers, not one value |
| \#4 | Larger denominator \= larger fraction | Believes 1/8 \> 1/4 because 8 \> 4 |
| \#5 | Fractions can't be \> 1 | Doesn't understand improper fractions |
| \#6 | Numerator \= denominator for "one whole" | Confusion about unit fractions and wholes |
| \#7 | Position on number line \= numerator only | Ignores denominator when placing fractions |
| \#8 | Different shapes can't show same fraction | Doesn't understand fraction equivalence across representations |
| \#9 | Adding fractions \= adding tops and bottoms | Treats numerator and denominator independently |
| \#10 | Fractions only apply to circles/pizzas | Limited mental model of fraction contexts |

### Tracking by Visual Type

Validators may specify visual context for more precise tracking:

- `Misconception_#3_RectangleBar`
- `Misconception_#3_NumberLine`
- `Misconception_#3_Grid`

These aggregate to the misconception level for Intervention triggers.

### Block 3: Reference Doc (references/lesson_script_schema_guide.md)
Purpose: Reference documentation
Cacheable: Yes

# REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION: references/lesson_script_schema_guide.md

<lesson_script_schema_guide>
# Lesson Script Schema Guide

Reference for the `lesson.json` script format. Covers every field, beat type, condition shape, and naming convention.

---

## Design Requirements

Two goals shape this schema.

### 1. Readability and Notion Portability

The format is human-readable first and machine-processed second. This makes it suitable for collaborative review in Notion, where non-engineers can read, comment on, and edit lesson content without touching raw JSON.

Key choices that serve this goal:

- **Plain-text content fields**: `dialogue.text` and `prompt.text` contain natural language, not markup or encoded content
- **Notion callout mapping**: each beat type maps to a specific Notion callout emoji (💬 dialogue, ❓ prompt, 🎬/🎞️ scene), so the JSON can round-trip to/from Notion without losing information on the editable fields
- **Selective editability**: only `dialogue.text` and `prompt.text` are editable in Notion; `scene` beats are display-only, so reviewers cannot inadvertently break structural logic
- **Human-readable IDs and slugs**: section IDs include a slug (e.g. `s1_1_most_votes`) so a reviewer can follow the navigation flow without reading code
- **`description` on validator states**: every validator state carries a plain-English description of the student condition it captures, making branching logic readable without interpreting condition syntax

### 2. Translatable Structured Data

The schema is an authored intermediate representation, not the final runtime format. It must be structured enough to be mechanically translated to a downstream schema (a runtime engine, a CMS, or a future schema revision).

Key choices that serve this goal:

- **Typed beats**: `type` is always explicit (`"dialogue"`, `"scene"`, `"prompt"`, `"current_scene"`), enabling switch-based translation with no ambiguity
- **Explicit targeting**: tangibles are always referenced by `tangible_id` or `tangible_type`, never by position or implicit state
- **No logic embedded in text**: conditions and branching live exclusively in `validator`; dialogue strings carry no conditional content
- **Flat, predictable field shapes**: each beat type has a fixed, documented field set; the only open-ended field is `params`, which is scoped to a specific `method` and documented
- **Validator as a declarative state machine**: validator states are a portable condition/goto structure with no runtime-specific implementation details, making them translatable to any branching execution model
- **IDs as the only coupling between sections**: sections are independent units; the schema makes no assumptions about execution order

These two goals can create tension: fully specified structured data tends toward verbosity, while readability pushes toward concision. The schema resolves this by separating concerns. Structural and logic fields are fully specified for translation fidelity, while human-facing fields (`text`, `description`, ID slugs) carry the readability load.

## Top-Level Structure

```json
{
  "id": "u3_m4_lesson",
  "sections": [ ... ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Sequence identifier. See format below. |
| `sections` | array | Ordered list of all sections (main, transition, remediation) |

### Lesson ID Format

```
u{unit}_m{module}_{phase}

u3_m4_lesson
u3_m4_warmup
u3_m4_synthesis
u3_m4_practice
u3_m4_exitcheck
```

| Segment | Description |
|---|---|
| `u{n}` | Unit number |
| `m{n}` | Module number within the unit |
| `{phase}` | One of: `lesson`, `warmup`, `synthesis`, `practice`, `exitcheck` |

---

## Section

```json
{
  "id": "s1_1_most_votes",
  "type": "remediation",
  "beats": [ ... ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | yes | Unique section ID. See [Naming Conventions](#section-id-naming-conventions). |
| `type` | string | no | `"transition"` or `"remediation"`. Omit for normal sections. |
| `beats` | array | yes | Flat array of all beats in this section |

Every section begins with an empty screen. There is no carry-over from the previous section. Everything visible must be explicitly put on screen by `scene` beats before it appears.

### Step Groups

Beats are flat, but are logically grouped into **step groups** — a group of beats that play together before the lesson pauses for student interaction. Step groups are delimited by `current_scene` beats: a new step group begins after each `current_scene`.

Beat order within a step group:

1. **`scene`** — things appear or change on screen
2. **`dialogue`** — the guide speaks
3. **`prompt`** — student interacts (at most one per step group)
4. **`current_scene`** — snapshot of the screen after all beats have played (always last in a step group)

```json
"beats": [
  { "type": "scene", "method": "show", "tangible_id": "pg_fruits" },
  { "type": "dialogue", "text": "You made a graph with your Minis' votes." },
  { "type": "prompt", "text": "Which fruit got the most votes? Click it.", "tool": "click_category", "target": "pg_fruits", "validator": [...] },
  { "type": "current_scene", "elements": [...] },
  { "type": "dialogue", "text": "Apples got 6 votes, the most of any fruit." },
  { "type": "current_scene", "elements": [...] }
]
```

### Section ID Naming Conventions

```
s{group}_{seq}_{slug}              →  s1_1_most_votes
s{group}_{seq}{variant}_{slug}     →  s2_2a_fewest_books
s{group}_transition                →  s2_transition
```

| Segment | Description |
|---|---|
| `s` | Fixed prefix |
| `{group}` | Concept group number, local to the unit/module, not the phase |
| `{seq}` | Sequence position within the group |
| `{variant}` | Optional letter suffix for sub-problems, e.g. `a`, `b`, `c` |
| `{slug}` | Human-readable label for the problem |

**Key rules:**
- Section IDs are **sequential**: `{group}` and `{seq}` reflect the order sections appear in the phase
- Some sections are **misconception specific**: written to address a known error pattern
  rather than advancing the main concept sequence

---

## Beat Types

### Scene

**Scene beats are the only way to change screen state.** If anything needs to appear, disappear, animate, or update — a tangible, a parameter, any visual state at all — it must come from a `scene` beat.

Display-only in Notion (🎬 callout for all methods).

Three targeting levels. Omit fields to broaden scope:

| Target | Fields present |
|---|---|
| Specific instance | `tangible_id` |
| All instances of a type | `tangible_type` |
| All instances on screen | neither |

`add` is the exception: it always requires both `tangible_id` and `tangible_type`.

Interactivity is **implicit**. A tangible becomes interactive when a prompt's `tool` targets it, and resets automatically when the prompt resolves. Use `lock`/`unlock` only for edge cases that need explicit control.

| Method | Notion icon | `params` fields | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `show` | 🎬 | — | Make tangible visible |
| `hide` | 🎬 | — | Remove tangible from view |
| `animate` | 🎬 | `event`, `status`, `description`, ...tangible-specific | Trigger a named animation |
| `update` | 🎬 | `description: string` (required), ...tangible-specific | Change toy state (highlighting, mode switch, template change, etc.) |
| `add` | 🎬 | tangible-specific config (optional) | Add a new instance to the scene |
| `remove` | 🎬 | — | Remove a tangible instance from the scene |
| `lock` | 🎬 | — | Prevent student interaction regardless of active prompt |
| `unlock` | 🎬 | — | Re-enable student interaction on a locked tangible |

**show / hide**
```json
{ "type": "scene", "method": "show", "tangible_id": "pg_fruits" }
{ "type": "scene", "method": "hide", "tangible_id": "data_table" }
```

**animate: specific instance**
```json
{
  "type": "scene",
  "method": "animate",
  "tangible_id": "bg_animals",
  "params": {
    "event": "draw_bar_guideline",
    "status": "proposed",
    "description": "Guideline draws from top of Monkeys bar to axis",
    "category": "Monkeys"
  }
}
```

**animate: all instances of a type**
```json
{
  "type": "scene",
  "method": "animate",
  "tangible_type": "picture_graph",
  "params": {
    "event": "transform_to_bar_graph",
    "status": "proposed",
    "description": "All picture graphs collapse into bar graphs"
  }
}
```

**update**
```json
{
  "type": "scene",
  "method": "update",
  "tangible_id": "bg_colors",
  "params": {
    "highlight_categories": ["Blue", "Yellow"],
    "description": "Blue and Yellow bars highlight."
  }
}
```

`params.description` is required on every `update` beat — plain English of what visually changes. Include any additional toy-specific state fields alongside it.

**add**
```json
{
  "type": "scene",
  "method": "add",
  "tangible_id": "numline_a",
  "tangible_type": "number_line",
  "params": { "min": 0, "max": 2 }
}
```

**remove**
```json
{ "type": "scene", "method": "remove", "tangible_id": "numline_a" }
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | `"scene"` | yes | |
| `method` | string | yes | `show` `hide` `animate` `update` `add` `remove` |
| `tangible_id` | string | conditional | Instance ID. Required for `add`. Omit to broaden scope to type or all. |
| `tangible_type` | string | conditional | Required for `add`. Omit to broaden scope to all instances on screen. |
| `params` | object | no | Method-specific configuration; omit when not needed |

---

### Dialogue

Narration or teacher speech. Editable in Notion (💬 callout).

```json
{
  "type": "dialogue",
  "text": "You made a graph with your Minis' votes. Each picture stands for one vote."
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "dialogue",
  "text": "Here's a graph: animals at the zoo. Every picture graph has a key that tells you what each symbol means.",
  "tags": ["vocabulary"]
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | `"dialogue"` | yes | |
| `text` | string | yes | Spoken/displayed text |
| `tags` | string[] | no | Semantic labels, e.g. `["vocabulary"]` |

---

### Prompt

Student interaction point. Text is editable in Notion (❔ callout).

**Workspace tool: single tangible**
```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "Which fruit got the most votes? Click it.",
  "tool": "click_category",
  "target": "pg_fruits",
  "validator": [...]
}
```

**Workspace tool: specific component**
```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "Click on the part that tells us what each symbol means.",
  "tool": "click_component",
  "target": "picture_graph_animals.key",
  "validator": [...]
}
```

**Workspace tool: explicit list of tangibles**
```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "Which graph shows the most cats?",
  "tool": "click_tangible",
  "target": ["pg_fruits", "pg_animals", "pg_pets"],
  "validator": [...]
}
```

**Workspace tool: all tangibles of a type**
```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "Which graph shows the most cats?",
  "tool": "click_tangible",
  "target": { "type": "picture_graph" },
  "validator": [...]
}
```

**Overlay tool**: generates its own UI, no tangible target.
```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "How many monkeys are at the zoo?",
  "tool": "multiple_choice",
  "options": [5, 6, 7, 8],
  "validator": [...]
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "Select all the categories you need to answer this question.",
  "tool": "multi_select",
  "options": ["Dogs", "Cats", "Fish", "Birds", "Lizards"],
  "validator": [...]
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | `"prompt"` | yes | |
| `text` | string | yes | Question or instruction shown to student |
| `tool` | string | yes | `click_category` · `click_component` · `click_tangible` · `multiple_choice` · `multi_select` |
| `target` | string \| string[] \| object | conditional | What the tool acts on. Omit for overlay tools. See shapes below. |
| `options` | array | conditional | Overlay tools only: `multiple_choice` and `multi_select`. Numbers or strings. |
| `validator` | array | yes | See [Validator](#validator) |

**`target` shapes:**

| Shape | When to use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `"tangible_id"` | Single tangible instance | `"target": "picture_graph_fruits"` |
| `"tangible_id.component"` | Specific component within a tangible | `"target": "picture_graph_animals.key"` |
| `["id1", "id2"]` | Explicit list of selectable instances | `"target": ["pg_fruits", "pg_animals"]` |
| `{ "type": "..." }` | All instances of a tangible type | `"target": { "type": "picture_graph" }` |

---

### current_scene

Always the last beat in every step group. It is a pure derived snapshot: it reflects only what `scene` beats have established. Within a section, tangibles carry forward step to step — a tangible stays on screen until a `scene` beat removes or hides it. `current_scene` never introduces new tangibles or state that no `scene` beat has declared.

```json
{
  "type": "current_scene",
  "elements": [
    {
      "tangible_id": "picture_graph_fruits",
      "description": "Horizontal picture graph. Favorite Fruits data. Apples row highlighted.",
      "tangible_type": "picture_graph",
      "mode": "reading",
      "orientation": "horizontal",
      "categories": ["Apples", "Bananas", "Oranges", "Grapes"]
    }
  ]
}
```

If the screen is empty, write `"elements": []`.

---

### empty

Used in validator state `beats` arrays to signal that no feedback is needed for this state. Preferred over an empty array (`[]`) because it makes the intent explicit — this state is intentionally silent, not accidentally incomplete.

```json
{ "type": "empty" }
```

Only valid inside validator state `beats`. Not used in outer section beats.

---

## Validator

A flat array of states evaluated **in order**; the first match wins. The final state is always an empty condition (`{}`) catch-all. Each state contains inline `beats`, which play when the state matches.

Every state must include `is_correct: true` or `is_correct: false`. `incorrect_count` is the one system parameter; all other condition keys are tangible-specific fields.

```json
"validator": [
  {
    "condition": { "selected": "Apples" },
    "description": "Student selected Apples",
    "is_correct": true,
    "beats": [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "animate", "tangible_id": "pg_fruits",
        "params": { "event": "highlight_category", "status": "confirmed",
                    "description": "Apples row highlights to confirm selection", "category": "Apples" } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "Apples got 6 votes, the most of any fruit." },
      { "type": "current_scene", "elements": [ { "tangible_id": "pg_fruits", "description": "Apples row highlighted.", "tangible_type": "picture_graph" } ] }

        "params": { "highlight_categories": ["Apples"], "description": "Apples row highlights." } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "Apples has 6 symbols, more than any other row. Click Apples." },
      { "type": "current_scene", "elements": [ { "tangible_id": "pg_fruits", "description": "Apples row highlighted.", "tangible_type": "picture_graph" } ] }
    ]
  }
]
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `condition` | object | Matching condition. Multiple keys implicitly ANDed. Use `or`/`and` arrays for explicit logic. |
| `description` | string | Precise plain-English description of exactly what student state this condition captures. |
| `is_correct` | boolean | **Required.** `true` if this state represents a correct student response, `false` otherwise. |
| `beats` | array | Flat array of beats to play when this state matches. Same structure as section `beats`. |

### Condition Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `selected` | string \| number | What the student selected from the tool's available options |
| `incorrect_count` | number | System counter: how many times the student has triggered a non-first-match state on this prompt. Max 3. |
| `tangible_id` | string | Scopes remaining keys to a specific tangible instance. Used when checking tangible state fields directly. |
| *(tangible fields)* | any | State fields exposed by the scoped tangible, used alongside `tangible_id` |

### Condition Logic

**Single tangible check:**
```json
{ "condition": { "selected": "Bananas", "incorrect_count": 1 } }
```

**Specific tangible field check:**
```json
{ "condition": { "tangible_id": "numline_a", "shaded_interval_count": 3 } }
```

**Multiple tangibles (AND):**
```json
{
  "condition": {
    "and": [
      { "tangible_id": "bar_a", "points": [1, 2] },
      { "tangible_id": "numline_a", "shaded_interval_count": 3 }
    ]
  }
}
```

**OR across values:**
```json
{ "condition": { "or": [{ "selected": "Oranges" }, { "selected": "Grapes" }] } }
```

**Negation:**
```json
{ "condition": { "not": { "selected": "Apples" } } }
```

**Fallback: empty object; always matches:**
```json
{}
```

## Remediation Pattern

Remediation is inline. Feedback beats live directly in validator states, not in separate sections. The three-level scaffold maps to `incorrect_count` values:

| Validator state | Hint style |
|---|---|
| `incorrect_count: 1` | Light: minimal nudge, direct attention without revealing the answer |
| `incorrect_count: 2` | Medium: partial reveal, show the key data, let the student conclude |
| catch-all `{}` | Heavy: full scaffold, state the answer explicitly, prompt to confirm |

Each state's `beats` contains the beats for that hint level. See the [Validator](#validator) section for a full example.

---

## Tangible ID Conventions

Tangible ID prefixes and naming patterns are defined in the toy spec files (`toy_specs/`). Consult the relevant toy spec for the canonical prefix and any instance-naming rules for that toy type.

---

## Beat Summary

| Type | Notion format | Editable | Fields |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scene` | 🎬 callout | no | `method`, `tangible_id`, `params?` |
| `dialogue` | 💬 callout | yes: `text` | `text`, `tags?` |
| `prompt` | ❔ callout | yes: `text` | `text`, `tool`, `options?`, `validator` |
| `current_scene` | 📋 toggle | no | `elements` |
| `empty` | plain text suffix | no | — (validator beats only) |

### Block 4: Instructions
Purpose: Step-by-step task instructions
Cacheable: Yes

# TASK INSTRUCTIONS


## TASK

The section to process is in `<input>`. Walk its `beats` array and find every `prompt` beat. For each prompt, generate the incorrect validator states. Output one inner array of states per prompt, in the order the prompts appear in the section.

**Skip any prompt whose `validator` is a single state with `condition: {}`** (any-response-advances). Emit nothing for it.

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

An array of arrays. One inner array per qualifying prompt, in section order:

```json
[
  [ <states for prompt 0> ],
  [ <states for prompt 1> ]
]
```

Each state follows the validator state schema:
```json
{
  "condition": { ... },
  "description": "...",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [ [ <beats> ] ]
}
```

`is_correct` must be `false` on every state you generate.

---

## STEP 1: DETECT QUESTION TYPE

For each qualifying prompt, check the `tool` field:

| `tool` | Track |
|---|---|
| `click_category`, `click_tangible`, `click_component`, or any workspace tool | **Non-MC** → Generic L-M-H |
| `multiple_choice` | **Single-Select MC** → Per-distractor Medium + Heavy |
| `multi_select` | **Multiselect MC** → Per-branch Medium + Heavy |

---

## STEP 2A: NON-MC: STATES

Follow `<remediation_design_ref>` Sections 2.4–2.5 for state structure and order. Always emit generic L/M/H after any specific-condition states. Follow length, visual, and language rules from `<remediation_design_ref>` Sections 4–6.

**Specific conditions** are pre-defined in the input. Inspect the existing `validator` for `is_correct: false` states with non-empty conditions (not just `{}`). Each such state has:
- `condition`: the base condition (e.g. `{ "container_count": 3 }`) — rewrite it into the `and`/`or` shape from the STATE ORDER section below
- `description`: a plain-English label for what wrong answer this represents
- `beats`: placeholder dialogue already written — use as inspiration when writing Medium-quality content (visual scaffold + 20–30 words)

For each specific condition, emit one state using the `and`/`or` condition shape from the STATE ORDER section below. Write or rewrite the dialogue and scene beats to Medium standard — do not just copy the placeholder beats verbatim.

**Two effective patterns for specific condition dialogue:**

- **Pattern A — Credit + narrow:** When the student got part right, acknowledge it, then narrow to the specific error. Close with a pointed question.
  > "You're right that there are 4 columns. But count how many dots are in each column. Are there 4?"

- **Pattern B — Name + redirect + point:** Name what the student did in one phrase, redirect to the correct concept, give one concrete action or question.
  > "You counted the Dogs. When we ask how many fewer, we need to find the difference. Count how far apart Dogs and Fish are."

In both patterns: the Medium answer rule applies — do not give the correct counts or values. The student still has to execute.

**Light** (`incorrect_count: 1`): dialogue only.
```json
{
  "condition": { "incorrect_count": 1 },
  "description": "Student answered incorrectly on first attempt",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [ { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." } ]
  ]
}
```

**Medium** (`incorrect_count: 2`): scene beat required. Dialogue teaches the method — name what to look at and in what order. Close with a pointed question or specific imperative.
```json
{
  "condition": { "incorrect_count": 2 },
  "description": "Student answered incorrectly on second attempt",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "update", "tangible_id": "...", "params": { "highlight_categories": ["..."] } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." }
    ]
  ]
}
```

**Heavy** (catch-all `{}`): `scene animate` beat required (system demonstrates the answer). Dialogue narrates the thinking, not just the mechanics — name the structure being demonstrated and connect each step to what it means. End with the underlying principle: why the answer has to be what it is, not just what the answer is. Take inspiration from the on_correct beat already in the section's validator — it names what was demonstrated for a student who got it right. The Heavy closing should echo that same structural insight, framed from the guide's perspective after modeling.
```json
{
  "condition": {},
  "description": "Student answered incorrectly three or more times. System models the answer.",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "animate", "tangible_id": "...",
        "params": { "event": "...", "status": "confirmed", "description": "..." } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." }
    ]
  ]
}
```

---

## STEP 2B: SINGLE-SELECT MC: PER-DISTRACTOR STATES

The correct option is in the correct state's `condition.selected`. All other values in `tool.options` are distractors.

See `<remediation_design_ref>` Section 3.2 for Single-Select MC structure (no Light state; per-distractor Mediums + one Heavy).

One **Medium** per distractor: scene beat required. Dialogue names the error and redirects to the correct concept or tool. Close with a pointed question or specific imperative.
```json
{
  "condition": { "selected": <distractor> },
  "description": "Student selected <distractor>: <why this is wrong>",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "update", "tangible_id": "...", "params": { "highlight_categories": ["..."] } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." }
    ]
  ]
}
```

One **Heavy** (`condition: {}`): `scene animate` beat required.
```json
{
  "condition": {},
  "description": "Student answered incorrectly. System models the correct answer.",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "animate", "tangible_id": "...",
        "params": { "event": "...", "status": "confirmed", "description": "..." } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." }
    ]
  ]
}
```

---

## STEP 2C: MULTISELECT MC: PER-BRANCH STATES

Identify **correct answers** from the success/correct validator state condition — these are the values listed under `selected` clauses. **Incorrect answers** are values listed under `not_selected` clauses in that same condition.

**First, detect the no-wrong-options variant:** Count `not_selected` clauses in the correct validator condition. If there are **none**, all options are correct — no wrong options exist. Follow Section 3B.9 of `<remediation_design_ref>` and emit only Branch 2 + Heavy. Do NOT invent phantom wrong option values.

For the **no-wrong-options variant**, every possible error is an under-selecting error — so use `incorrect_count` conditions (same as Non-MC L/M/H). Do NOT use Branch 2/3/4 conditions.

**Light** (`incorrect_count: 1`) — dialogue only:
```json
{
  "condition": { "incorrect_count": 1 },
  "description": "Student has not selected all correct answers (first attempt)",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [ { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." } ]
  ]
}
```
Use a short nudge (10–20 words) pointing toward completeness — e.g. "Read the scenarios carefully. Did you select ALL?" Adapt to the content.

**Medium** (`incorrect_count: 2`) — scene beat required:
```json
{
  "condition": { "incorrect_count": 2 },
  "description": "Student has not selected all correct answers (second attempt)",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "update", "tangible_id": "...", "params": { "description": "..." } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." }
    ]
  ]
}
```

**Heavy** (`condition: {}`) — `scene animate` beat required. Models all correct answers.

For the **standard variant** (has at least one `not_selected` clause = has wrong options), identify all options not listed as `selected` in the correct condition as incorrect answers. See `<remediation_design_ref>` Section 3B for structure, branch definitions, language requirements, and condition patterns (no Light; Branches 2/3/4 Mediums + one Heavy).

One **Medium per branch**: scene beat required.
```json
{
  "condition": { <see Section 3B.7 for correct condition logic per branch> },
  "description": "Branch <N>: <description of student's selection state>",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "update", "tangible_id": "...", "params": { "highlight_categories": ["..."] } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." }
    ]
  ]
}
```

One **Heavy** (`condition: {}`): `scene animate` beat required. Shared fallback for all branches.
```json
{
  "condition": {},
  "description": "Student answered incorrectly. System models the correct answer.",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "animate", "tangible_id": "...",
        "params": { "event": "...", "status": "confirmed", "description": "..." } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." }
    ]
  ]
}
```

---

## STATE ORDER

**Non-MC inner array:**
1. One Medium per specific condition (if any) — `{ "and": [{ specific_condition }, { "or": [{"incorrect_count": 1}, {"incorrect_count": 2}] }] }`
2. Generic Light — `{ "and": [{"incorrect_count": 1}, {"not": { specific_condition }}, ...] }` (one `not` per specific condition)
3. Generic Medium — `{ "and": [{"incorrect_count": 2}, {"not": { specific_condition }}, ...] }` (one `not` per specific condition)
4. Generic Heavy (`condition: {}`): always last

**Single-Select MC inner array:**
1. One Medium per distractor (any order among themselves)
2. Heavy (`condition: {}`): always last

**Multiselect MC inner array (standard — has wrong options):**
1. Branch 2 Medium — under-selecting
2. Branch 3 Medium — all-wrong
3. Branch 4 Medium — mixed
4. Heavy (`condition: {}`): always last

**Multiselect MC inner array (no-wrong-options variant — zero `not_selected` in correct condition):**
1. Light — `{ "incorrect_count": 1 }` — dialogue only
2. Medium — `{ "incorrect_count": 2 }` — scene beat required
3. Heavy — `condition: {}` — always last

---

## LANGUAGE RULES

Follow all language patterns, word counts, visual requirements, and prohibited constructs from `<remediation_design_ref>` Sections 4–8 and 12.4.

**Light:** Use openers from Sections 4.1–4.2. Cycle — do not reuse the same phrase within a section.

**Medium:** Use a starter from Section 5.1. Cycle — do not reuse within a section.

**Medium — universal answer rule (applies to all tracks and specific conditions):** Never state the correct answer, value, or count in a Medium. This applies even when the answer is visible on screen (e.g. a key showing "Each ⭐ = 5", a label, a highlighted number). Redirect the student to the right place and let them read it. A Medium that names the answer removes the work the student needs to do. If you find yourself writing the correct value in a Medium, rewrite it as a question or imperative that sends the student to look.

**Heavy:** Use an opener from Section 6.1. Cycle — do not reuse within a section. End with closure per Section 7.

---

## SCOPE CONSTRAINTS

Use vocabulary naturally from <vocabulary>. Do not use phrases from <forbidden_phrases>. Reference <required_phrases> in Medium/Heavy where genuinely appropriate. Ground explanations in <the_one_thing>. Keep tangible references consistent with the section's `scene` array and existing scene beats.

When <lesson_sections> is available, use it to align correction language with how the lesson taught the concept — match the vocabulary the guide used in earlier sections and frame corrections in terms the student has already encountered.

For prompts with `"variable_answer": true`: do not assume the student's specific attempt in Light or Medium dialogue. For Heavy, model one specific valid example but frame it as one way, not the only answer.

---

## OUTPUT RULES

- Output ONLY the `incorrects` array content. No explanation, no markdown fences.
- The prefill already opens `{"id": "...", "incorrects": [`. Complete from that point.
- Use double quotes throughout
- `is_correct: false` on every state
- Do not use em dashes (—) or double hyphens (--) in any text field; to create a pause or connect two thoughts, use a period or comma instead
