## SECTION 1: System Architecture Overview

### 1.1 The Simplified Model

**v3 introduces a two-track approach based on question type:**

| Question Type | Remediation Approach | Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Non-MC** (create, shade, place, etc.) | Generic L-M-H only | Error cause often ambiguous; tracking handles patterns |
| **Multiple Choice** | Per-distractor branching | We know exactly which wrong answer; targeted feedback valuable |

**Why This Works:**

- Non-MC errors are noisy—kids click wrong for many reasons
- MC distractors give clear diagnostic signal about thinking
- True misconceptions are caught by pattern tracking, not single-instance diagnosis
- Content volume becomes manageable without sacrificing quality

### 1.2 The Two Systems Working Together

```
IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK (This Document)
├── Non-MC: Generic L-M-H
│   └── Validators tag probable error type (for tracking only)
└── MC: Per-distractor Medium + Heavy
    └── Targeted feedback based on which wrong answer chosen

PATTERN DETECTION (Background)
├── Rolling window tracks misconception indicators
├── Threshold triggers Intervention Activity
└── Intervention queued as next activity
```

### 1.3 Core Principles (Unchanged)

- **Sequential only:** Light → Medium → Heavy (max 3 attempts)
- **Never alternatives:** No "Try X or Y" or "Another way to think about it"
- **Progressive support:** Each level provides meaningfully more help
- **System takeover:** After Heavy, system moves student forward

### 1.4 What Changed from v2

| v2 (Old) | v3 (New) |
| :---- | :---- |
| Three remediation types at each level (Generic, Common Error, Misconception) | Non-MC: Generic only; MC: Per-distractor |
| System detects error type and selects remediation in real-time | Non-MC: No detection needed; MC: Distractor choice is the detection |
| 9-15 remediation pieces per question | 3 pieces (non-MC) or 4-5 pieces (MC) |
| Misconception addressed via targeted immediate feedback | Misconception addressed via Intervention after pattern detected |

---

## SECTION 2: Non-MC Remediation (Generic L-M-H)

### 2.1 Overview

For all non-multiple-choice interactions (shading, partitioning, placing on number lines, dragging, etc.), use **Generic remediation only**.

**The validator still tags the probable error type** for misconception tracking, but the student receives generic feedback regardless of detected error.

### 2.2 Why Generic Works

- Single errors are noisy—we can't reliably diagnose from one mistake
- Pattern detection across multiple opportunities is more accurate
- Reduces content creation burden dramatically
- Interventions (when triggered) provide better conceptual support than in-the-moment micro-corrections

### 2.3 Non-MC Flow

```
Student attempts → Wrong
    ↓
Light Remediation (generic)
    ↓
Student attempts → Wrong
    ↓
Medium Remediation (generic) + Visual scaffold
    ↓
Student attempts → Wrong
    ↓
Heavy Remediation (generic) + Full modeling → Reveals answer
    ↓
System moves forward

[Background: Validator logs probable error type for tracking]
```

### 2.4 Non-MC Structure

**Light (10-20 words):** Brief redirect, no visual **Medium (20-30 words):** Conceptual reminder \+ visual scaffold **Heavy (30-60 words):** Full modeling with \[Modeling\] tag, reveals answer

---

## SECTION 3: MC Remediation (Per-Distractor Branching)

### 3.1 Overview

For multiple choice questions, we know exactly which wrong answer the student chose. Each distractor represents a specific error or misconception, so we can provide **targeted feedback**.

### 3.2 MC Structure

For a 4-option MC question (1 correct \+ 3 distractors):

- **3 Medium remediations** (one per distractor)
- **1 Heavy remediation** (explains the correct answer)

**No Light remediation for MC.** Rationale: If they knew the right answer, they would have picked it. A generic "check your answer" rarely helps when we have specific diagnostic information.

### 3.3 MC Flow

```
Student selects Distractor A → Wrong
    ↓
Medium A (targeted to Distractor A's error) + Visual scaffold
    ↓
Student selects Distractor B → Wrong
    ↓
Medium B (targeted to Distractor B's error) + Visual scaffold
    ↓
Student selects any wrong answer → Wrong
    ↓
Heavy (explains correct answer) + Full modeling
    ↓
System moves forward
```

**Same distractor twice:** Student receives the same Medium again. This provides reinforcement and removes any gaming incentive (no shortcut to Heavy/completion).

### 3.4 MC Distractor Design Principles

Each distractor should represent a **diagnosable error:**

| Distractor Type | Example | Medium Focus |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Numerator/denominator confusion | Selected 4/3 instead of 3/4 | "The numerator tells us how many parts we have, not the total" |
| Counted total instead of shaded | Selected 6/6 when 4/6 shaded | "Count only the shaded parts for the numerator" |
| Ignored equal parts requirement | Selected unequal partition | "For fractions, all parts must be equal size" |
| Whole number thinking | Selected 3 instead of 3/4 | "We need a fraction—the bottom number tells us the size of parts" |

### 3.5 Metacognitive MC Questions

Metacognitive questions ("Which strategy would help?", "What should you check first?") are **highest value for branching**. Each wrong strategy choice reveals specific thinking patterns we can address.

---

## SECTION 4: Light Remediation Language Patterns

**Length:** 10-20 words
**Tone:** Brief and direct
**Visual:** None
**Applies to:** Non-MC interactions only (MC skips Light)

### 4.1 With Error Signal (40-50% of interactions)

Use at beginning of module, after successes, when student might think they're right:

- "Not quite. \[specific guidance\]"
- "Almost. \[specific guidance\]"
- "Let's try again. \[specific guidance\]"
- "Let's look at this problem again."
- "Let's take another look."
- "Let's try that again."
- "Let's look closely—\[specific guidance\]"

### 4.2 Without Error Signal (50-60% of interactions)

Use mid-module, when error is obvious, to avoid repetition:

- Direct guidance with no preamble
- "Check \[specific element\]"
- "Count \[specific element\]"
- "Focus on \[specific element\]"
- Simple imperative statements

### 4.3 Guidance Alternatives to "Remember"

Save "Remember" for Medium/Heavy. At Light level, use:

- "The key is..."
- "Focus on..."
- "Notice that..."
- "Here's what helps..."
- "Check the..."

### 4.4 Light Examples

- "Not quite. Count the shaded parts only."
- "Check the spacing between marks."
- "Focus on equal-sized parts."
- "Let's look closely—which parts are shaded?"
- "Count from zero, not from one."

---

## SECTION 5: Medium Remediation Language Patterns

**Length:** 20-30 words
**Tone:** Acknowledge struggle, collaborative
**Visual:** REQUIRED (from Visual Scaffolds TSV)
**Applies to:** Both Non-MC and MC

### 5.1 Approved Starters (Non-MC)

- "Let's think about this together. \[specific help\]"
- "Here's a hint: \[specific clue\]"
- "You're working on it. Here's what helps: \[specific support\]"
- "You're getting there. The key is \[crucial detail\]"
- "Let's think about this a bit more. \[guidance\]"

### 5.2 MC Medium Structure

For MC, Medium is targeted to the specific distractor chosen:

**Template:**

```
[Medium_Remediation - Distractor_A] [Meta_Remediation]: "[20-30 words addressing why Distractor A is wrong and redirecting thinking]"
[Visual: Scaffold highlighting the specific error]
```

**Example (student chose 6/6 when 4/6 was shaded):**

```
[Medium_Remediation - Distractor_B] [Meta_Remediation]: "You counted all the parts. The numerator only counts the shaded parts—how many are filled in?"
[Visual: Shaded parts pulse/highlight, unshaded parts dim]
```

### 5.3 Medium Examples (Non-MC)

- "Let's think about this together. Four fourths equals 1, then three more fourths gets us to 7/4." \[Visual: Number line with 4/4 marked at 1\]
- "Here's a hint: each fourth stays the same size, even past 1." \[Visual: Equal jumps highlighted\]
- "You're working on it. Count the shaded parts for the top number." \[Visual: Shaded sections pulse\]

### 5.4 "Remember" Usage

- Maximum 2-3 times per entire module
- Medium/Heavy only (never Light)
- Use for genuinely important callbacks to prior learning

---

## SECTION 6: Heavy Remediation Language Patterns

**Length:** 30-60 words
**Tone:** Full support, complete demonstration
**Visual:** REQUIRED (full modeling demonstration)
**Tag:** \[Modeling\] REQUIRED
**Applies to:** Both Non-MC and MC

### 6.1 Approved Opening Language

- "This is tricky, so let's work through it together..."
- "This can be tricky, so let's do it together."
- "Let me show you how this works."
- "Here, let me walk you through this one."
- "Let's work through this step by step..."
- "These can be challenging. Let me show you..."
- "Let me help a bit more."

### 6.2 Heavy Structure (Non-MC)

```
[Heavy_Remediation] [Meta_Remediation] [Modeling]: "[30-60 words with complete step-by-step demonstration]"
[Visual: System demonstrates complete solution]
Guide: "[Post-modeling acknowledgment]"
```

### 6.3 Heavy Structure (MC)

For MC, Heavy explains why the correct answer is right:

```
[Heavy_Remediation] [Meta_Remediation] [Modeling]: "[30-60 words explaining the correct answer and demonstrating the thinking]"
[Visual: Correct answer highlighted with supporting scaffold]
Guide: "[Post-modeling acknowledgment]"
```

### 6.4 Heavy Examples

**Non-MC:** "This is tricky, so let me show you. First, I count the total parts—that's my denominator: 4\. Then I count just the shaded parts—that's my numerator: 3\. So the fraction is 3/4." \[Visual: System highlights total parts, then shaded parts, then shows 3/4\]

**MC:** "Let me show you how to think about this. The question asks which fraction is shown. I count 4 equal parts total—that's the denominator. 3 parts are shaded—that's the numerator. So the answer is 3/4, not 4/3." \[Visual: Correct answer highlighted, visual shows counting sequence\]

---

## SECTION 7: Post-Modeling Language

After Heavy remediation with \[Modeling\], use **only** language that acknowledges assisted success:

### 7.1 Approved Post-Modeling Phrases

- "There we go."
- "See how that works?"
- "It's okay if this is tricky."
- "You're getting it now."
- "Now you understand."
- "That makes sense now, right?"
- "That's it—now you've got it."
- "Good—you understand now."
- "Now you see the pattern."

### 7.2 NEVER Use After Modeling

- ❌ "Perfect\!" (they didn't do it alone)
- ❌ "You figured it out\!" (guide showed them)
- ❌ "Great job\!" (too independent)
- ❌ "Excellent work\!" (overpraises assisted work)

### 7.3 Post-Modeling Transitions

After Heavy remediation, move forward assuming understanding:

- "Let's try another one."
- "Now let's continue."
- "Ready for the next?"
- "Let's keep going."

---

## SECTION 8: Error Signal Strategy

### 8.1 When to Use Error Signals

Use error signals (40-50% of Light remediations) when:

- Beginning of module (establish pattern)
- After successes (clear change signal)
- When student might think they're right
- Ambiguous errors

### 8.2 When to Skip Error Signals

Skip error signals (50-60% of Light remediations) when:

- Error is obvious
- Would cause repetition
- Mid-module routine corrections
- Guidance itself implies error

### 8.3 Variety Requirement

Never repeat the same error signal phrase within 3 interactions. Rotate through:

- "Not quite."
- "Almost."
- "Let's try again."
- "Let's look at this problem again."
- "Let's take another look."

---

## SECTION 9: Misconception Tracking & Intervention Triggers

### 9.1 How Tracking Works

Even though non-MC remediation is generic, **validators tag the probable error type** for every wrong answer. This feeds the misconception tracking system.

```
Student makes error → Generic remediation served
                   → Validator logs: "Probable Misconception #3"
                   → Running count updated

[After phase transition]
System checks: Has any misconception hit threshold?
    YES → Queue Intervention Activity
    NO → Continue normal flow
```

### 9.2 Tracking Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Trigger threshold** | 5 errors (placeholder) | TBD with data |
| **Rolling window** | Last 20 opportunities | Natural decay mechanism |
| **Window spans** | Lesson, Exit Check, Practice, Spiral Review, Test Prep | Cross-activity tracking |
| **Check timing** | Phase transitions | Engineer to confirm feasibility |
| **Post-Intervention threshold** | Window lowers to 15 | Catches continued struggle faster |

### 9.3 What Gets Tracked

**Tracked (feeds Intervention triggers):**

- Misconception indicators (\#1-\#10)
- Tracked per visual type for accuracy
- Combined at misconception level for Intervention trigger

**Not Tracked for Intervention:**

- Common procedural errors (counting mistakes, off-by-one)
- Random/ambiguous errors

### 9.4 Example Tracking Flow

```
Opportunity 1: Error on Rectangle Bar → Validator: Misconception #3 → Count: 1
Opportunity 5: Error on Number Line → Validator: Misconception #3 → Count: 2
Opportunity 9: Error on Rectangle Bar → Validator: Misconception #3 → Count: 3
Opportunity 14: Error on Grid → Validator: Misconception #3 → Count: 4
Opportunity 18: Error on Rectangle Bar → Validator: Misconception #3 → Count: 5 ← THRESHOLD

[At next phase transition]
→ Misconception #3 Intervention queued as next activity
```

---

## SECTION 10: Intervention Activity Overview

### 10.1 What Interventions Are

Intervention Activities are **standalone instructional sequences** that address a specific misconception directly. They sit outside regular modules and slot into the activity queue when triggered.

### 10.2 Intervention Scope

- **\~10 total** (one per misconception)
- **Combines visuals** (not visual-specific)
- **Path-flexible** (may use visuals from multiple paths with worked examples)

### 10.3 Intervention Structure

| Phase | Name | Purpose | Approach |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | **Clarify** | Name the misconception | Metacognitive: "A lot of students think X. Let's look at why that's tricky..." |
| 2 | **Model** | Worked examples | Guide demonstrates across 2-3 examples using multiple visuals |
| 3 | **Confirm** | Independent verification | 2-3 problems student completes independently |

### 10.4 Queue Placement

- Intervention replaces whatever activity would have been next
- Multiple triggers \= multiple Interventions queued with brain breaks between
- Follows existing recess/break logic in Activity Queue

### 10.5 After Intervention

- Rolling window lowers to 15 (from 20\)
- If misconception continues to appear, re-triggers faster
- Alternative: Queue targeted Practice problems before re-triggering full Intervention

## SECTION 11: Remediation by Phase

### 11.1 Requirements by Phase

| Phase | Non-MC Requirement | MC Requirement | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Warmup | Light minimum | Per-distractor Medium \+ Heavy | Heavy if key prior knowledge |
| Lesson | Full L-M-H | Per-distractor Medium \+ Heavy | All interactions |
| Exit Check | Full L-M-H | Per-distractor Medium \+ Heavy | MANDATORY \- gateway phase |
| Practice | Full L-M-H | Per-distractor Medium \+ Heavy | Light only for confidence builders |
| Synthesis | Light minimum | Per-distractor Medium \+ Heavy | Full L-M-H for pattern discovery |
| Challenge | None | None | Assessment mode |

### 11.2 Module Complexity Considerations

**Modules 1-3 (Simple concepts):**

- Light remediation may be sufficient for some interactions
- Simpler language appropriate
- Don't force full L-M-H if unnecessary

**Modules 4-8 (Building complexity):**

- Full L-M-H progression more common
- Can reference earlier module strategies

**Modules 9-12 (Complex concepts):**

- Full L-M-H usually needed
- More nuanced explanations appropriate

**Documentation:** Use \[Pedagogical\_Override\] when reality differs from stated requirements.

---

## APPENDIX: Misconception Reference

### Full Misconception List

| ID | Misconception | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| \#1 | Unequal parts acceptable | Believes fractions don't require equal-sized parts |
| \#2 | Numerator \= total parts | Confuses numerator with denominator |
| \#3 | Fractions aren't numbers | Sees fractions as two separate numbers, not one value |
| \#4 | Larger denominator \= larger fraction | Believes 1/8 \> 1/4 because 8 \> 4 |
| \#5 | Fractions can't be \> 1 | Doesn't understand improper fractions |
| \#6 | Numerator \= denominator for "one whole" | Confusion about unit fractions and wholes |
| \#7 | Position on number line \= numerator only | Ignores denominator when placing fractions |
| \#8 | Different shapes can't show same fraction | Doesn't understand fraction equivalence across representations |
| \#9 | Adding fractions \= adding tops and bottoms | Treats numerator and denominator independently |
| \#10 | Fractions only apply to circles/pizzas | Limited mental model of fraction contexts |

### Tracking by Visual Type

Validators may specify visual context for more precise tracking:

- `Misconception_#3_RectangleBar`
- `Misconception_#3_NumberLine`
- `Misconception_#3_Grid`

These aggregate to the misconception level for Intervention triggers.

### Block 3: Reference Doc (references/lesson_script_schema_guide.md)
Purpose: Reference documentation
Cacheable: Yes

# REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION: references/lesson_script_schema_guide.md

<lesson_script_schema_guide>
# Lesson Script Schema Guide

Reference for the `lesson.json` script format. Covers every field, beat type, condition shape, and naming convention.

---

## Design Requirements

Two goals shape this schema.

### 1. Readability and Notion Portability

The format is human-readable first and machine-processed second. This makes it suitable for collaborative review in Notion, where non-engineers can read, comment on, and edit lesson content without touching raw JSON.

Key choices that serve this goal:

- **Plain-text content fields** — `dialogue.text` and `prompt.text` contain natural language, not markup or encoded content
- **Notion callout mapping** — each beat type maps to a specific Notion callout emoji (💬 dialogue, ❓ prompt, 🎬/🎞️ scene), so the JSON can round-trip to/from Notion without losing information on the editable fields
- **Selective editability** — only `dialogue.text` and `prompt.text` are editable in Notion; `scene` beats are display-only, so reviewers cannot inadvertently break structural logic
- **Human-readable IDs and slugs** — section IDs include a slug (e.g. `s1_1_most_votes`) so a reviewer can follow the navigation flow without reading code
- **`description` on validator states** — every validator state carries a plain-English description of the student condition it captures, making branching logic readable without interpreting condition syntax

### 2. Translatable Structured Data

The schema is an authored intermediate representation — not the final runtime format. It must be structured enough to be mechanically translated to a downstream schema (a runtime engine, a CMS, or a future schema revision).

Key choices that serve this goal:

- **Typed beats** — `type` is always explicit (`"dialogue"`, `"scene"`, `"prompt"`), enabling switch-based translation with no ambiguity
- **Explicit targeting** — tangibles are always referenced by `tangible_id` or `tangible_type`, never by position or implicit state
- **No logic embedded in text** — conditions and branching live exclusively in `validator`; dialogue strings carry no conditional content
- **Flat, predictable field shapes** — each beat type has a fixed, documented field set; the only open-ended field is `params`, which is scoped to a specific `method` and documented
- **Validator as a declarative state machine** — validator states are a portable condition/goto structure with no runtime-specific implementation details, making them translatable to any branching execution model
- **IDs as the only coupling between sections** — sections reference each other only via `goto` section IDs; the schema makes no assumptions about execution order beyond what those references specify

These two goals can create tension: fully specified structured data tends toward verbosity, while readability pushes toward concision. The schema resolves this by separating concerns — structural and logic fields are fully specified for translation fidelity, while human-facing fields (`text`, `description`, ID slugs) carry the readability load.

---

## Top-Level Structure

```json
{
  "id": "u3_m4_lesson",
  "sections": [ ... ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Sequence identifier — see format below |
| `sections` | array | Ordered list of all sections (main, transition, remediation) |

### Lesson ID Format

```
u{unit}_m{module}_{phase}

u3_m4_lesson
u3_m4_warmup
u3_m4_synthesis
u3_m4_practice
u3_m4_exitcheck
```

| Segment | Description |
|---|---|
| `u{n}` | Unit number |
| `m{n}` | Module number within the unit |
| `{phase}` | One of: `lesson`, `warmup`, `synthesis`, `practice`, `exitcheck` |

---

## Section

```json
{
  "id": "s1_1_most_votes",
  "type": "remediation",
  "scene": ["pg_fruits", "data_table"],
  "steps": [ [...], [...] ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | yes | Unique section ID — see [Naming Conventions](#section-id-naming-conventions) |
| `type` | string | no | `"transition"` or `"remediation"`. Omit for normal sections. |
| `scene` | string[] | no | Tangible IDs on screen when the section begins |
| `steps` | array[] | yes | Array of steps; each step is an array of beats |

### Section ID Naming Conventions

```
s{group}_{seq}_{slug}              →  s1_1_most_votes
s{group}_{seq}{variant}_{slug}     →  s2_2a_fewest_books
s{group}_transition                →  s2_transition
```

| Segment | Description |
|---|---|
| `s` | Fixed prefix |
| `{group}` | Concept group number — local to the unit/module, not the phase |
| `{seq}` | Sequence position within the group |
| `{variant}` | Optional letter suffix for sub-problems, e.g. `a`, `b`, `c` |
| `{slug}` | Human-readable label for the problem |

**Key rules:**
- Section IDs are **unit/module specific** — they belong to a content area, not a phase
- The same section can appear in multiple phases (lesson, warmup, synthesis, practice, exitcheck)
- Some sections are **misconception specific** — written to address a known error pattern
  rather than advancing the main concept sequence
- Some sections are **validator-state dependent child sections** — they only execute
  when a specific validator state is triggered. Remediation sections (`_light`, `_medium`,
  `_heavy`) are the current example of this pattern, but other branching types will exist
  (e.g. sections addressing a specific wrong answer, or sections unlocked by a correct
  answer to a prerequisite prompt). These are always referenced via `child_section` in a
  validator state, never appear in the main sequence directly.

---

## Steps

`steps` is an **array of arrays**. Each inner array is one step — a group of beats that play together before the lesson pauses for student interaction.

```json
"steps": [
  [beat, beat, beat],   // step 1 — scene setup + dialogue + prompt
  [beat, beat]          // step 2 — follow-up after correct answer
]
```

---

## Beat Types

### Dialogue

Narration or teacher speech. Editable in Notion (💬 callout).

```json
{
  "type": "dialogue",
  "text": "You made a graph with your Minis' votes. Each picture stands for one vote."
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "dialogue",
  "text": "Here's a graph: animals at the zoo. Every picture graph has a key that tells you what each symbol means.",
  "tags": ["vocabulary"]
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | `"dialogue"` | yes | |
| `text` | string | yes | Spoken/displayed text |
| `tags` | string[] | no | Semantic labels, e.g. `["vocabulary"]` |

---

### Scene

Manipulates a tangible on screen. Display-only in Notion (method emoji callout). Basic scene changes use 🎬; elaborate animation events use 🎞️.

Three targeting levels — omit fields to broaden scope:

| Target | Fields present |
|---|---|
| Specific instance | `tangible_id` |
| All instances of a type | `tangible_type` |
| All instances on screen | neither |

`add` is the exception — it always requires both `tangible_id` and `tangible_type`.

Interactivity is **implicit** — a tangible becomes interactive when a prompt's `tool` targets it, and resets automatically when the prompt resolves. Use `lock`/`unlock` only for edge cases that need explicit control.

| Method | Notion icon | `params` fields | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `show` | 🎬 | — | Make tangible visible |
| `hide` | 🎬 | — | Remove tangible from view |
| `animate` | 🎞️ | `event`, `status`, `description`, ...tangible-specific | Trigger a named animation |
| `update` | 🎬 | `highlight_categories: string[]` | Highlight specific categories |
| `add` | 🎬 | tangible-specific config (optional) | Add a new instance to the scene |
| `remove` | 🎬 | — | Remove a tangible instance from the scene |
| `lock` | 🎬 | — | Prevent student interaction regardless of active prompt |
| `unlock` | 🎬 | — | Re-enable student interaction on a locked tangible |

**show / hide**
```json
{ "type": "scene", "method": "show", "tangible_id": "pg_fruits" }
{ "type": "scene", "method": "hide", "tangible_id": "data_table" }
```

**animate — specific instance**
```json
{
  "type": "scene",
  "method": "animate",
  "tangible_id": "bg_animals",
  "params": {
    "event": "draw_bar_guideline",
    "status": "proposed",
    "description": "Guideline draws from top of Monkeys bar to axis",
    "category": "Monkeys"
  }
}
```

**animate — all instances of a type**
```json
{
  "type": "scene",
  "method": "animate",
  "tangible_type": "picture_graph",
  "params": {
    "event": "transform_to_bar_graph",
    "status": "proposed",
    "description": "All picture graphs collapse into bar graphs"
  }
}
```

**update**
```json
{
  "type": "scene",
  "method": "update",
  "tangible_id": "bg_colors",
  "params": { "highlight_categories": ["Blue", "Yellow"] }
}
```

**add**
```json

  "type": "scene",
  "method": "add",
  "tangible_id": "numline_a",
  "tangible_type": "number_line",
  "params": { "min": 0, "max": 2 }
}
```

**remove**
```json
{ "type": "scene", "method": "remove", "tangible_id": "numline_a" }
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | `"scene"` | yes | |
| `method` | string | yes | `show` `hide` `animate` `update` `add` `remove` |
| `tangible_id` | string | conditional | Instance ID. Required for `add`. Omit to broaden scope to type or all. |
| `tangible_type` | string | conditional | Required for `add`. Omit to broaden scope to all instances on screen. |
| `params` | object | no | Method-specific configuration; omit when not needed |

---

### Prompt

Student interaction point. Text is editable in Notion (❓ callout).

**Workspace tool — single tangible:**
```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "Which fruit got the most votes? Click it.",
  "tool": "click_category",
  "target": "pg_fruits",
  "validator": [...]
}
```

**Workspace tool — specific component:**
```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "Click on the part that tells us what each symbol means.",
  "tool": "click_component",
  "target": "picture_graph_animals.key",
  "validator": [...]
}
```

**Workspace tool — explicit list of tangibles:**
```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "Which graph shows the most cats?",
  "tool": "click_tangible",
  "target": ["pg_fruits", "pg_animals", "pg_pets"],
  "validator": [...]
}
```

**Workspace tool — all tangibles of a type:**
```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "Which graph shows the most cats?",
  "tool": "click_tangible",
  "target": { "type": "picture_graph" },
  "validator": [...]
}
```

**Overlay tool** — generates its own UI, no tangible target:
```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "How many monkeys are at the zoo?",
  "tool": "multiple_choice",
  "options": [5, 6, 7, 8],
  "validator": [...]
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "Select all the categories you need to answer this question.",
  "tool": "multi_select",
  "options": ["Dogs", "Cats", "Fish", "Birds", "Lizards"],
  "validator": [...]
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | `"prompt"` | yes | |
| `text` | string | yes | Question or instruction shown to student |
| `tool` | string | yes | `click_category` · `click_component` · `click_tangible` · `multiple_choice` · `multi_select` |
| `target` | string \| string[] \| object | conditional | What the tool acts on. Omit for overlay tools. See shapes below. |
| `options` | array | conditional | Overlay tools only — `multiple_choice` and `multi_select`. Numbers or strings. |
| `validator` | array | yes | See [Validator](#validator) |

**`target` shapes:**

| Shape | When to use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `"tangible_id"` | Single tangible instance | `"target": "picture_graph_fruits"` |
| `"tangible_id.component"` | Specific component within a tangible | `"target": "picture_graph_animals.key"` |
| `["id1", "id2"]` | Explicit list of selectable instances | `"target": ["pg_fruits", "pg_animals"]` |
| `{ "type": "..." }` | All instances of a tangible type | `"target": { "type": "picture_graph" }` |

---

## Validator

A flat array of states evaluated **in order**; the first match wins. The final state is always an empty condition (`{}`) catch-all. Each state contains inline `steps` — beats that play when the state matches.

Every state must include `is_correct: true` or `is_correct: false`. `incorrect_count` is the one system parameter; all other condition keys are tangible-specific fields.

```json
"validator": [
  {
    "condition": { "selected": "Apples" },
    "description": "Student selected Apples",
    "is_correct": true,
    "steps": [
      [
        { "type": "dialogue", "text": "Apples got 6 votes — the most of any fruit." }
      ]
    ]
  },
  {
    "condition": { "incorrect_count": 1 },
    "description": "Student selected any wrong answer on first attempt",
    "is_correct": false,
    "steps": [
      [
        { "type": "dialogue", "text": "Look at the numbers next to each row. Which one is biggest?" }
      ]
    ]
  },
  {
    "condition": { "incorrect_count": 2 },
    "description": "Student selected any wrong answer on second attempt",
    "is_correct": false,
    "steps": [
      [
        { "type": "scene", "method": "update", "tangible_id": "pg_fruits",
          "params": { "highlight_categories": ["Apples"] } },
        { "type": "dialogue", "text": "Count the Apples row — 6 symbols. Count the others: Bananas 4, Oranges 5, Grapes 3. Which row has the most?" }
      ]
    ]
  },
  {
    "condition": {},
    "description": "Catch-all — any remaining state",
    "is_correct": false,
    "steps": [
      [
        { "type": "scene", "method": "update", "tangible_id": "pg_fruits",
          "params": { "highlight_categories": ["Apples"] } },
        { "type": "dialogue", "text": "Apples has 6 symbols — more than any other row. Click Apples." }
      ]
    ]
  }
]
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `condition` | object | Matching condition. Multiple keys implicitly ANDed. Use `or`/`and` arrays for explicit logic. |
| `description` | string | Precise plain-English description of exactly what student state this condition captures. |
| `is_correct` | boolean | **Required.** `true` if this state represents a correct student response, `false` otherwise. |
| `steps` | array[] | Inline beats to play when this state matches. Same structure as section `steps`. |

### Condition Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `selected` | string \| number | What the student selected from the tool's available options |
| `incorrect_count` | number | System counter — how many times the student has triggered a non-first-match state on this prompt. Max 3. |
| `tangible_id` | string | Scopes remaining keys to a specific tangible instance. Used when checking tangible state fields directly. |
| *(tangible fields)* | any | State fields exposed by the scoped tangible — used alongside `tangible_id` |

### Condition Logic

**Single tangible check:**
```json
{ "condition": { "selected": "Bananas", "incorrect_count": 1 } }
```

**Specific tangible field check:**
```json
{ "condition": { "tangible_id": "numline_a", "shaded_interval_count": 3 } }
```

**Multiple tangibles (AND):**
```json
{
  "condition": {
    "and": [
      { "tangible_id": "bar_a", "points": [1, 2] },
      { "tangible_id": "numline_a", "shaded_interval_count": 3 }
    ]
  }
}
```

**OR across values:**
```json
{ "condition": { "or": [{ "selected": "Oranges" }, { "selected": "Grapes" }] } }
```

**Fallback — empty object; always matches:**
```json
{}
```

## Remediation Pattern

Remediation is inline — feedback beats live directly in validator states, not in separate sections. The three-level scaffold maps to `incorrect_count` values:

| Validator state | Hint style |
|---|---|
| `incorrect_count: 1` | Light — minimal nudge, direct attention without revealing the answer |
| `incorrect_count: 2` | Medium — partial reveal, show the key data, let the student conclude |
| catch-all `{}` | Heavy — full scaffold, state the answer explicitly, prompt to confirm |

Each state's `steps` contains the beats for that hint level. See the [Validator](#validator) section for a full example.

---

## Tangible ID Conventions

Tangibles are defined outside `lesson.json` but referenced by ID throughout. Observed prefixes:

| Prefix | Type | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `picture_graph_` | Picture graph | `picture_graph_fruits`, `picture_graph_animals`, `picture_graph_pets` |
| `bar_graph_` | Bar graph | `bar_graph_animals`, `bar_graph_books`, `bar_graph_colors` |
| `data_table` | Data table UI component | `data_table` |
| `choice_input` | Answer input widget | `choice_input` |

---

## Beat Summary

| Type | Notion format | Editable | Fields |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dialogue` | 💬 callout | yes — `text` | `text`, `tags?` |
| `scene` | method-emoji callout | no | `method`, `tangible_id`, `params?` |
| `prompt` | ❓ callout | yes — `text` | `text`, `tool`, `options?`, `validator` |

### Block 4: Instructions
Purpose: Step-by-step task instructions
Cacheable: Yes

# TASK INSTRUCTIONS


## TASK

The section to process is in `<input>`. Walk its `steps` array and find every `prompt` beat. For each prompt, generate the incorrect validator states. Output one inner array of states per prompt, in the order the prompts appear in the section.

**Skip any prompt whose `validator` is a single state with `condition: {}`** (any-response-advances) — emit nothing for it.

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

An array of arrays. One inner array per qualifying prompt, in section order:

```json
[
  [ <states for prompt 0> ],
  [ <states for prompt 1> ]
]
```

Each state follows the validator state schema:
```json
{
  "condition": { ... },
  "description": "...",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [ [ <beats> ] ]
}
```

`is_correct` must be `false` on every state you generate.

---

## STEP 1 — DETECT QUESTION TYPE

For each qualifying prompt, check `tool.name`:

| `tool.name` | Track |
|---|---|
| `click_category`, `click_tangible`, or any workspace tool | **Non-MC** → Generic L-M-H |
| `multiple_choice`, `multi_select` | **MC** → Per-distractor Medium + Heavy |

---

## STEP 2A — NON-MC: THREE STATES

Emit in this order:

**Light** (`incorrect_count: 1`) — 10–20 words, dialogue only:
```json
{
  "condition": { "incorrect_count": 1 },
  "description": "Student answered incorrectly on first attempt",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [ { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." } ]
  ]
}
```

**Medium** (`incorrect_count: 2`) — 20–30 words + one `scene update` or `scene animate` beat:
```json
{
  "condition": { "incorrect_count": 2 },
  "description": "Student answered incorrectly on second attempt",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "update", "tangible_id": "...", "params": { "highlight_categories": ["..."] } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." }
    ]
  ]
}
```

**Heavy** (`condition: {}`) — 30–60 words + `scene animate` beat (system demonstrates the answer):
```json
{
  "condition": {},
  "description": "Student answered incorrectly three or more times — system models the answer",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "animate", "tangible_id": "...",
        "params": { "event": "...", "status": "confirmed", "description": "..." } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "This is tricky, so let me show you. ..." }
    ]
  ]
}
```

---

## STEP 2B — MC: PER-DISTRACTOR STATES

The correct option is in the correct state's `condition.selected`. All other values in `tool.options` are distractors.

**No Light state for MC.**

One **Medium** per distractor — 20–30 words + scene beat:
```json
{
  "condition": { "selected": <distractor> },
  "description": "Student selected <distractor> — <why this is wrong>",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "update", "tangible_id": "...", "params": { "highlight_categories": ["..."] } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "..." }
    ]
  ]
}
```

One **Heavy** (`condition: {}`) — 30–60 words + `scene animate` beat:
```json
{
  "condition": {},
  "description": "Student answered incorrectly — system models the correct answer",
  "is_correct": false,
  "steps": [
    [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "animate", "tangible_id": "...",
        "params": { "event": "...", "status": "confirmed", "description": "..." } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "Let me show you how this works. ..." }
    ]
  ]
}
```

---

## STATE ORDER

**Non-MC inner array:**
1. Light (`incorrect_count: 1`)
2. Medium (`incorrect_count: 2`)
3. Heavy (`condition: {}`) — always last

**MC inner array:**
1. One Medium per distractor (any order among themselves)
2. Heavy (`condition: {}`) — always last

---

## LANGUAGE RULES

**Light (non-MC only):**
- 10–20 words. No scene beat.
- Use error signals 40–50% of the time: "Not quite.", "Almost.", "Let's try again."
- Or skip the signal: "Count the shaded parts only.", "Check the spacing."
- Never use "Remember" at Light level.

**Medium:**
- 20–30 words. One scene beat required.
- Starters: "Let's think about this together.", "Here's a hint:", "You're working on it."
- For MC: address specifically why the chosen distractor is wrong.

**Heavy:**
- 30–60 words. One `scene animate` beat required — system demonstrates the answer.
- Opens with: "This is tricky, so let me show you.", "Let me show you how this works."
- States the correct answer explicitly with step-by-step demonstration.
- Post-modeling acknowledgment where natural: "See how that works?", "There we go."

**Never:**
- Alternative paths ("Try X or Y")
- Post-modeling independent-success praise ("Great job!", "Perfect!", "Excellent work!")

---

## SCOPE CONSTRAINTS

Use vocabulary naturally from <vocabulary>. Do not use phrases from <forbidden_phrases>. Reference <required_phrases> in Medium/Heavy where genuinely appropriate. Ground explanations in <the_one_thing>. Keep tangible references consistent with the section's `scene` array and existing scene beats.

---

## OUTPUT RULES

- Output ONLY the `incorrects` array content — no explanation, no markdown fences
- The prefill already opens `{"id": "...", "incorrects": [` — complete from that point
- Use double quotes throughout
- `is_correct: false` on every state
