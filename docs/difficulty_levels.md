## MASTERY TIERS

Difficulty increases through: **parameter complexity**, **visual complexity**, **scaffolding**, and **cognitive demand**.

### Support
**Simplified parameters with additional scaffolding**

- **Purpose:** Build confidence after struggle; provide accessible entry point
- **Target:** 15-20% of problem pool
- **Key Principle:** Simpler versions of the same skill, NOT different concepts
- **Parameter Complexity:** Easiest variables (halves, unit fractions, smaller denominators like 2-3)
- **Visual Design:** Single, straightforward visual with obvious, high-contrast features
- **Scaffolding:** Additional guides, hints visible, or reference visuals shown
- **Cognitive Demand:** Simple recognition or one-step action with heavy guidance
- **Mastery Status:** Does NOT count toward mastery (support only)

### Confidence
**Very simple problems with maximum scaffolding**

- **Purpose:** Build confidence before retry; early practice with clear scaffolding
- **Target:** 10-15% of problem pool
- **Key Principle:** The simplest possible version of the skill being taught
- **Parameter Complexity:** Common, familiar variables (thirds, fourths, simple unit fractions)
- **Visual Design:** Single visual with clear, obvious features
- **Scaffolding:** Maximum scaffolding (labeled tick marks, highlighted features, reference examples)
- **Cognitive Demand:** Direct application of one concept with step-by-step guidance
- **Mastery Status:** Does NOT count toward mastery (confidence building only)

### Baseline
**Core grade-level problems; mastery expectations begin here**

- **Purpose:** Standard mastery assessment at grade-level expectations
- **Target:** 40-50% of problem pool (largest portion)
- **Key Principle:** Problems vary in difficulty but stay within grade-level expectations
- **Parameter Complexity:** Mix of common and less common variables (halves through sixths, mix of unit and non-unit fractions)
- **Visual Design:** May include 2-3 visuals or moderate contrast between options
- **Scaffolding:** Standard presentation without extra support
- **Cognitive Demand:** Clear task requiring understanding, not just pattern-matching
- **Mastery Status:** COUNTS TOWARD MASTERY

### Stretch
**More challenging parameters with less scaffolding**

- **Purpose:** Challenge students who show baseline mastery; deeper exploration
- **Target:** 20-25% of problem pool (second largest portion)
- **Key Principle:** Extends thinking without introducing new concepts
- **Parameter Complexity:** Less familiar variables (sixths, eighths) or multiple fractions to consider
- **Visual Design:** Multiple visuals (3-4) with reduced contrast, requiring careful comparison
- **Scaffolding:** Less scaffolding; fewer labeled elements
- **Cognitive Demand:** Multi-step reasoning, comparing multiple representations, or inverse operations
- **Mastery Status:** COUNTS TOWARD MASTERY

### Challenge
**Most difficult parameters with no scaffolding**

- **Purpose:** Enrichment for advanced students
- **Target:** 5-10% of problem pool
- **Key Principle:** Extends thinking to maximum complexity without leaving the core concept
- **Parameter Complexity:** Most complex variables (eighths, larger numerators, mixed denominators) or abstract scenarios
- **Visual Design:** Many visuals (4+) with subtle differences, or abstract/decontextualized representations
- **Scaffolding:** No scaffolding; may include distractors
- **Cognitive Demand:** Complex reasoning, ordering, transferring across contexts, or sophisticated pattern recognition
- **Mastery Status:** COUNTS TOWARD MASTERY
