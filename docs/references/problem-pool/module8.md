# MODULE 8 PATH B (SINGAPORE) — LESSON ANALYSIS

---

## ACTIONS DEMONSTRATED IN LESSON

| Action | Description | Steps Where Used | Can Do Multiples? |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `select_choice` | Select from multiple choice options (Same/Different, etc.) | Step 1 | No |
| `select_tangible` | Click to select a specific bar/object | Step 4 | No |
| `place_point` (Move tool) | Place marker at position on number line | Steps 10, 11 | Yes (sequential) |
| `paint` | Click to shade parts of a fraction bar | Steps 7, 16 | Yes (multiple parts) |

**Critical:** Practice problems must use ONLY these four action types.

---

## CONCEPTS EXPLICITLY TAUGHT

1. **Visual comparison of same-sized bars** — "Do they show the same amount?" (Step 1\)
2. **"Equivalent" vocabulary** — "Equal \- the same amount, just written differently" (Step 2\)
3. **Same Whole requirement** — Fractions can only be equivalent when comparing same-sized wholes (Step 6\)
4. **Primary equivalence chain** — 1/2 \= 2/4 \= 3/6 \= 4/8 (Steps 5, 8\)
5. **Secondary equivalence chain** — 2/3 \= 4/6 (Steps 14-16)
6. **Number line verification** — Equivalent fractions land at the same point (Steps 10-11)
7. **Creating equivalents by splitting** — "Each third becomes TWO sixths when split" (Steps 14-15)
8. **Pattern articulation** — "Pieces get smaller, we shade more, but total amount stays the same" (Step 8\)

# MODULE 8 PATH B (SINGAPORE) — GOAL DECOMPOSITION

---

## LEARNING GOALS

**L1 (Verbatim):** "Identify equivalent fractions; two fractions are equivalent if they are the same size and refer to the same whole."

**L2 (Verbatim):** "Generate and justify simple equivalent fractions using visual models."

**Module Focus:** VISUAL PROOF of equivalence. Students recognize equivalent fractions by comparing same-sized bars, verify equivalence on number lines ("same point"), and create simple equivalents by shading. Vocabulary ("equivalent") is introduced early. The Same Whole requirement is explicitly taught.

---

## MASTERY ASSUMPTION

**Students entering M8 have MASTERED (from M7):**

- Recognizing that b/b \= 1 (numerator equals denominator means one whole) ✓
- Explaining WHY b/b \= 1 using "all parts" reasoning ✓
- Writing whole numbers as fractions with any denominator ✓
- Placing points on 0-2 number lines fluently ✓
- Connecting patterns across representations ✓

**Therefore, M8 Practice does NOT need standalone templates for:**

- ~~Basic number line placement~~ (mastered in M5-M7)
- ~~Recognizing b/b \= 1~~ (M7 content)
- ~~Explaining why 4/4 \= 1~~ (M7 content)

**M8 Practice focuses on what's GENUINELY NEW:**

1. **Conceptual:** Recognizing equivalence between DIFFERENT fractions (1/2 \= 2/4), not just b/b \= 1
2. **Conceptual:** Understanding the Same Whole requirement
3. **Procedural:** Creating equivalent fractions by shading (new `paint` action)
4. **Transfer:** Verifying equivalence on number lines; applying to fractions \> 1

---

## COMPONENT A: CONCEPTUAL (35-40%)

*What students UNDERSTAND — the concept of equivalence*

---

### M8-01: Recognize that equivalent fractions show the same amount of the same-sized whole

**Builds on:** M7-01 (recognize b/b \= 1); M7-08 (connect across representations) **What's New:** Generalizing from "b/b \= 1" to "different fractions can be equal" (1/2 \= 2/4)

**Lesson Alignment:** Step 1 — "Check if they show the same amount or different amounts"; Step 2 — "Equivalent means equal"

**What It Looks Like:** Student compares two fraction bars and determines whether they show the same amount; selects "Same" or "Different."

**Verbs:** identify **Tiers:** confidence, support, baseline **Templates:** 8001, 8002

---

### M8-02: Understand that equivalence requires the SAME WHOLE

**Builds on:** NEW — not taught in M7 **What's New:** Critical constraint — fractions can only be equivalent when comparing same-sized wholes

**Lesson Alignment:** Step 6 — "1/2 of a granola bar and 2/4 of a school bus aren't equal because the wholes are different sizes."

**What It Looks Like:** Student identifies that comparisons require same-sized wholes; rejects equivalence claims when wholes differ.

**Verbs:** identify **Tiers:** support, baseline, stretch **Templates:** 8003

---

### M8-03: Explain WHY fractions are equivalent using "same amount" reasoning

**Builds on:** M7-02 (explain WHY b/b \= 1\) **What's New:** Extending explanation from "all parts \= whole" to "same total amount shaded"

**Lesson Alignment:** Step 8 — "The pieces get smaller, so we shade more pieces, but the total amount stays the same."

**What It Looks Like:** Student selects correct explanation for why 1/2 \= 2/4 (same amount shaded, different number of pieces).

**Verbs:** identify **Tiers:** baseline, stretch **Templates:** 8004

---

## COMPONENT B: PROCEDURAL (30-35%)

*What students DO — executing recognition, verification, and creation*

---

### M8-04: Select equivalent fraction bar from a set of options

**Builds on:** M7-01 (pattern recognition from sets) **What's New:** Selecting equivalent from multiple bars (not just identifying b/b \= 1\)

**Lesson Alignment:** Step 4 — "Which bar below shows an equivalent fraction—the same amount as 1/2?"

**What It Looks Like:** Given a reference bar (e.g., 1/2), student clicks the bar that shows an equivalent fraction from 2-3 options.

**Verbs:** identify **Tiers:** confidence, support, baseline **Templates:** 8005, 8006

---

### M8-05: Place point on number line to verify equivalence

**Builds on:** M5-M7 number line fluency **What's New:** Using number line as PROOF tool — "same point means equivalent"

**Lesson Alignment:** Steps 10-11 — Place 1/2, then place 2/4 and see they land at the same point

**What It Looks Like:** Student places marker for a fraction on a number line; confirms it lands at the same position as an equivalent fraction.

**Verbs:** create **Tiers:** support, baseline, stretch **Templates:** 8007, 8008

---

### M8-06: Shade parts to create equivalent fraction

**Builds on:** NEW — `paint` action introduced in M8 **What's New:** GENERATION skill — student creates the equivalent, not just identifies it

**Lesson Alignment:** Step 7 — "How many eighths would equal one half? Click on parts to shade them."; Step 16 — "Shade to keep the same amount as two thirds."

**What It Looks Like:** Given a reference fraction (e.g., 1/2 bar), student shades an empty bar to create the equivalent (e.g., shade 4 of 8 parts for 4/8).

**Verbs:** create **Tiers:** baseline, stretch, challenge **Templates:** 8009, 8010

---

## COMPONENT C: TRANSFER (25-30%)

*How students APPLY — new contexts, chains, and multi-step problems*

---

### M8-07: Apply equivalence to 2/3 family (2/3 \= 4/6)

**Builds on:** M8-04, M8-06 (recognition and creation skills) **What's New:** Secondary equivalence chain — extends beyond 1/2 family

**Lesson Alignment:** Steps 14-16 — "Each third becomes TWO sixths when split... 2/3 \= 4/6"

**What It Looks Like:** Student recognizes or creates equivalents in the 2/3 family using same strategies learned with 1/2 family.

**Verbs:** create, identify **Tiers:** baseline, stretch **Templates:** 8010 (creation), 8011 (recognition/verification)

---

### M8-08: Verify equivalence for fractions \> 1 on 0-2 number line

**Builds on:** M6-02 (place fractions \> 1); M8-05 (number line verification) **What's New:** TRANSFER of equivalence concept to beyond-1 fractions

**Lesson Alignment:** Skill transfer — Lesson uses 0-1 lines; this extends to 0-2 range from M6-M7

**What It Looks Like:** Student verifies that 3/2 and 6/4 land at the same point on a 0-2 number line, demonstrating equivalence works past 1\.

**Verbs:** create **Tiers:** stretch, challenge **Templates:** 8012

---

### M8-09: Multi-step: Identify equivalent bars → Verify on number line

**Builds on:** M8-04 (bar recognition); M8-05 (number line verification) **What's New:** Combining two proof strategies in sequence

**Lesson Alignment:** Combines Steps 4 and 10-11 — visual comparison on bars followed by number line confirmation

**What It Looks Like:** Step 1: Student selects equivalent bar from options. Step 2: Student places both fractions on a number line to verify they land at the same point.

**Verbs:** create **Tiers:** baseline, stretch, challenge **Templates:** 8013

---

### M8-10: Apply equivalence to real-world contexts

**Builds on**: M8-01 (recognition); M8-04 (selection) What's New: Transfer to contextualized situations — dialogue frames abstract bars as real objects

**Lesson Alignment:** Step 6's "granola bar" example; extends to varied contexts

**What It Looks Like:** Dialogue describes a real-world scenario (chocolate bars, pizza, ribbon). Student identifies equivalent amounts using same visual comparison skills, but in a contextualized frame.

**Verbs**: apply Tiers: support, baseline, stretch Templates: 8014

- "Two identical ribbons are cut differently. One shows 1/2 shaded, one shows 2/4 shaded. Are these amounts equivalent?"
- "Mia has a granola bar. Jake has an identical granola bar. Mia ate 3/6 and Jake ate 1/2. Did they eat the same amount?"
- "One pizza is small, one is large. Both have 1/2 eaten. Is the amount eaten the same?"
- "Two same-sized juice boxes. One shows 2/4 full, one shows 4/8 full. Do they have the same amount?"

🟣 **SUCCESS DIALOGUE**

- "Right. The wholes are different sizes, so we can't say the amounts are equal."
- "Yes — identical wholes and equivalent fractions means the same amount."
- "Exactly. Same-sized wholes let us compare fairly."

**Verb Distribution Status: ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE — see rationale**

**Rationale:**

- `create` elevated because M8's core skill is GENERATING equivalent fractions (L2 focus)
- `compare` elevated because equivalence IS comparison — this is the module's conceptual heart
- `identify` elevated due to recognition-before-generation pedagogical sequence
- All verbs represented; distribution reflects module goals

## 9\. TWO-STEP TEMPLATE VALIDATION

| Template | Step 1 | Step 2 | Skill Combination | Tier Range |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 8013 | select\_tangible (equivalent bar) | place\_point (number line) | M8-04 \+ M8-05 | baseline, stretch, challenge |

**Two-Step Design Rationale:**

- Combines visual recognition with number line verification
- Reinforces that equivalence can be proven multiple ways
- Step 1 validates before Step 2 appears (prevents guessing)
- Matches lesson structure (bars shown first, then number line confirmation)

**Two-Step Template Status: ✅ PROPERLY STRUCTURED**

---

## 10\. NUMBER LINE WORKSPACE VALIDATION

| Template | Workspace Design | Status |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 8007 | Two NumLines stacked (reference pre-placed, student places equivalent) | ✅ Matches lesson pattern |
| 8008 | Two NumLines stacked (reference pre-placed, student places equivalent) | ✅ Matches lesson pattern |
| 8012 | Two NumLines stacked, 0-2 range (reference pre-placed, student places equivalent) | ✅ Matches lesson pattern |
| 8013 | Two NumLines stacked in Step 2 (reference pre-placed, student places equivalent) | ✅ Matches lesson pattern |

**Number Line Status: ✅ ALL USE TWO-LINE COMPARISON (not overlapping points)**

---

## 11\. SPECIAL TEMPLATE NOTES

### 8002 Multi-Select Constraint

- Limited to 2 pairs (4 FracShapes) due to 5-toy maximum
- 1 equivalent pair, 1 non-equivalent pair per problem
- Adequate for pattern recognition; consider expansion if toy limit increases

### 8003 Word-Based Design

- No visual toys required (dialogue-driven)
- Tests internalized Same Whole understanding
- Key signal words: "identical" vs "small...large"
- Can add visual support later if needed

### 8015 Notation-Only Design

- No visual toys (text/symbol only)
- Tests M9-readiness (abstract equivalence)
- Stretch/challenge only — not for all students
- Data collection: identifies who's ready to advance

## 13\. RECOMMENDATIONS

### Accept As-Is

The template set meets all critical requirements. Key strengths:

- Paint action (NEW) well-scaffolded through 8009 → 8010 progression
- 2/3 family properly introduced as transfer, not direct instruction
- 0-2 number line appropriately placed at stretch/challenge
- Word-based Same Whole test (8003) allows conceptual assessment without blocked visuals
- Notation-only template (8015) provides M9-readiness signal

### Optional Enhancements (If Teacher Feedback Requests)

| Enhancement | Rationale | Implementation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Add Same Whole distractor to 8001 | Strengthen \#8 coverage | Include one option pair with visually different bar sizes in distractor design notes |
| Expand 8002 if toy limit increases | More pattern recognition data | Add 3rd pair when 6+ toys supported |
| Add confidence tier to 8015 | Lower entry for notation | Add simpler 1/2 \= 2/4 notation problems for students showing readiness |

### Flagged for Teacher Review

1. **8003 word-based format:** Confirm scenario language is age-appropriate and signal words ("identical" vs "small...large") are clear
2. **8010 paint action difficulty:** 2/3 family generation may be challenging — confirm stretch/challenge placement is appropriate
3. **8012 fractions beyond 1:** Verify students have sufficient 0-2 number line experience from M6-M7
4. **8015 notation-only:** Confirm this is appropriate diagnostic for M8 (Concrete) or should move to M9 (Abstract)

## 14\. COMPARISON TO M7 COVERAGE

| Metric | M7 | M8 | Change |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Total Problems | 69 | 84 | \+15 (generation practice \+ real-world contexts) |
| Templates | 12 | 15 | \+3 (8003 word-based, 8014 real-world, 8015 notation) |
| Procedural % | 0% | 38% | \+38% (paint action introduced) |
| Conceptual % | 30% | 24% | \-6% (shifted to procedural generation) |
| Transfer % | 70% | 38% | \-32% (M7 was formalization-heavy) |
| Two-step templates | 2 | 1 | \-1 (M8 focuses on single-skill mastery first) |
| compare verb | 6% | 18% | \+12% (equivalence IS comparison) |
| NEW action | — | paint | Shading to create equivalents |

**Evolution Summary:** M8 shifts from M7's formalization (naming patterns) to M8's generation (creating equivalents). The reintroduction of procedural component reflects that students must now DO something new (paint/shade), not just recognize patterns. Transfer remains substantial but focused on new contexts (2/3 family, 0-2 line, real-world, notation) rather than bidirectional fluency.
