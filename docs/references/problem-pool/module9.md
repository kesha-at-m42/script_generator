### **MISCONCEPTION PRIORITY**

**PRIMARY (target in 3+ templates):**

**\#7 \- Difficulty Recognizing Equivalence**

* What it looks like: Not seeing 1/2 \= 2/4 on number line
* Detection: Places fractions at different positions

**\#4 \- Improper Spacing (from M4-6)**

* What it looks like: Confuses counting on different denominator lines
* Detection: Incorrect position placement on second line

**SECONDARY (target in 1-2 templates):**

**\#2 \- Misidentifying the Whole (from M4-6)**

* What it looks like: Confuses fractions \> 1 with whole numbers
* Detection: Places 8/4 at position 8 instead of position 2

**\#10 \- Overgeneralizing Rules**

* What it looks like: "Bigger number always means bigger fraction"
* Detection: Incorrect reasoning about equivalence patterns

## REVISED TEMPLATE 9010 \- Select Equivalents from Mixed Representations

SKILL Student can identify equivalent fractions across different visual representations

PROBLEM TYPE Student multi-selects all models (bars and number lines) that show fractions equivalent to target

PROMPT EXAMPLES

* "Which models show fractions equivalent to 1/4? Click all that apply."
* "Find all the models equal to 1/2. Select all correct ones."
* "Some are bars, some are lines. Which show 2/3?"
* "Click every model that equals 1/3."

SUCCESS DIALOGUE

* "Right. You found all the equivalents."
* "Correct. Same fraction in different models."
* "Yes. Bars and lines both show equivalence."
* "Good eye. You recognized it across representations."

TIER-SPECIFIC SCAFFOLDING

* Baseline: 4 models (2 bars, 2 lines), 2 are equivalent to target
* Stretch: 6 models (3 bars, 3 lines), 2-3 are equivalent to target

EXAMPLE PROBLEM (Baseline):

```
Target: 1/2
Select all models that show 1/2 or an equivalent fraction:
□ Model A: [##|  ] (1/2 bar) ✓
□ Model B: 0──●────1 (point at 1/3) ✗
□ Model C: [##|##|    ] (2/4 bar) ✓
□ Model D: 0─●─●─●─●─1 (point at 3/4) ✗
```

Correct selections: A, C
