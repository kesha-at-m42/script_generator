# Lesson Script Schema Guide

Reference for the `lesson.json` script format. Covers every field, beat type, condition shape, and naming convention.

---

## Design Requirements

Two goals shape this schema.

### 1. Readability and Notion Portability

The format is human-readable first and machine-processed second. This makes it suitable for collaborative review in Notion, where non-engineers can read, comment on, and edit lesson content without touching raw JSON.

Key choices that serve this goal:

- **Plain-text content fields**: `dialogue.text` and `prompt.text` contain natural language, not markup or encoded content
- **Notion callout mapping**: each beat type maps to a specific Notion callout emoji (💬 dialogue, ❓ prompt, 🎬/🎞️ scene), so the JSON can round-trip to/from Notion without losing information on the editable fields
- **Selective editability**: only `dialogue.text` and `prompt.text` are editable in Notion; `scene` beats are display-only, so reviewers cannot inadvertently break structural logic
- **Human-readable IDs and slugs**: section IDs include a slug (e.g. `s1_1_most_votes`) so a reviewer can follow the navigation flow without reading code
- **`description` on validator states**: every validator state carries a plain-English description of the student condition it captures, making branching logic readable without interpreting condition syntax

### 2. Translatable Structured Data

The schema is an authored intermediate representation, not the final runtime format. It must be structured enough to be mechanically translated to a downstream schema (a runtime engine, a CMS, or a future schema revision).

Key choices that serve this goal:

- **Typed beats**: `type` is always explicit (`"dialogue"`, `"scene"`, `"prompt"`, `"current_scene"`), enabling switch-based translation with no ambiguity
- **Explicit targeting**: tangibles are always referenced by `tangible_id` or `tangible_type`, never by position or implicit state
- **No logic embedded in text**: conditions and branching live exclusively in `validator`; dialogue strings carry no conditional content
- **Flat, predictable field shapes**: each beat type has a fixed, documented field set; the only open-ended field is `params`, which is scoped to a specific `method` and documented
- **Validator as a declarative state machine**: validator states are a portable condition/goto structure with no runtime-specific implementation details, making them translatable to any branching execution model
- **IDs as the only coupling between sections**: sections are independent units; the schema makes no assumptions about execution order

These two goals can create tension: fully specified structured data tends toward verbosity, while readability pushes toward concision. The schema resolves this by separating concerns. Structural and logic fields are fully specified for translation fidelity, while human-facing fields (`text`, `description`, ID slugs) carry the readability load.

## Top-Level Structure

```json
{
  "id": "u3_m4_lesson",
  "sections": [ ... ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Sequence identifier. See format below. |
| `sections` | array | Ordered list of all sections (main, transition, remediation) |

### Lesson ID Format

```
u{unit}_m{module}_{phase}

u3_m4_lesson
u3_m4_warmup
u3_m4_synthesis
u3_m4_practice
u3_m4_exitcheck
```

| Segment | Description |
|---|---|
| `u{n}` | Unit number |
| `m{n}` | Module number within the unit |
| `{phase}` | One of: `lesson`, `warmup`, `synthesis`, `practice`, `exitcheck` |

---

## Section

```json
{
  "id": "s1_1_most_votes",
  "type": "remediation",
  "beats": [ ... ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | yes | Unique section ID. See [Naming Conventions](#section-id-naming-conventions). |
| `type` | string | no | `"transition"` or `"remediation"`. Omit for normal sections. |
| `beats` | array | yes | Flat array of all beats in this section |

Every section begins with an empty screen. There is no carry-over from the previous section. Everything visible must be explicitly put on screen by `scene` beats before it appears.

### Step Groups

Beats are flat, but are logically grouped into **step groups** — a group of beats that play together before the lesson pauses for student interaction. Step groups are delimited by `current_scene` beats: a new step group begins after each `current_scene`.

Beat order within a step group:

1. **`scene`** — things appear or change on screen
2. **`dialogue`** — the guide speaks
3. **`prompt`** — student interacts (at most one per step group)
4. **`current_scene`** — snapshot of the screen after all beats have played (always last in a step group)

```json
"beats": [
  { "type": "scene", "method": "show", "tangible_id": "pg_fruits" },
  { "type": "dialogue", "text": "You made a graph with your Minis' votes." },
  { "type": "prompt", "text": "Which fruit got the most votes? Click it.", "tool": "click_category", "target": "pg_fruits", "validator": [...] },
  { "type": "current_scene", "elements": [...] },
  { "type": "dialogue", "text": "Apples got 6 votes, the most of any fruit." },
  { "type": "current_scene", "elements": [...] }
]
```

### Section ID Naming Conventions

```
s{group}_{seq}_{slug}              →  s1_1_most_votes
s{group}_{seq}{variant}_{slug}     →  s2_2a_fewest_books
s{group}_transition                →  s2_transition
```

| Segment | Description |
|---|---|
| `s` | Fixed prefix |
| `{group}` | Concept group number, local to the unit/module, not the phase |
| `{seq}` | Sequence position within the group |
| `{variant}` | Optional letter suffix for sub-problems, e.g. `a`, `b`, `c` |
| `{slug}` | Human-readable label for the problem |

**Key rules:**
- Section IDs are **sequential**: `{group}` and `{seq}` reflect the order sections appear in the phase
- Some sections are **misconception specific**: written to address a known error pattern
  rather than advancing the main concept sequence

## Beat Types

### Scene

**Scene beats are the only way to change screen state.** If anything needs to appear, disappear, animate, or update — a tangible, a parameter, any visual state at all — it must come from a `scene` beat.

Display-only in Notion (🎬 callout for all methods).

Three targeting levels. Omit fields to broaden scope:

| Target | Fields present |
|---|---|
| Specific instance | `tangible_id` |
| All instances of a type | `tangible_type` |
| All instances on screen | neither |

`add` is the exception: it always requires both `tangible_id` and `tangible_type`.

Interactivity is **implicit**. A tangible becomes interactive when a prompt's `tool` targets it, and resets automatically when the prompt resolves. Use `lock`/`unlock` only for edge cases that need explicit control.

| Method | Notion icon | `params` fields | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `show` | 🎬 | — | Make tangible visible |
| `hide` | 🎬 | — | Remove tangible from view |
| `animate` | 🎬 | `event`, `status`, `description`, ...tangible-specific | Trigger a named animation |
| `update` | 🎬 | `description: string` (required), ...tangible-specific | Change toy state (highlighting, mode switch, template change, etc.) |
| `add` | 🎬 | tangible-specific config (optional) | Add a new instance to the scene |
| `remove` | 🎬 | — | Remove a tangible instance from the scene |
| `lock` | 🎬 | — | Prevent student interaction regardless of active prompt |
| `unlock` | 🎬 | — | Re-enable student interaction on a locked tangible |

**show / hide**
```json
{ "type": "scene", "method": "show", "tangible_id": "pg_fruits" }
{ "type": "scene", "method": "hide", "tangible_id": "data_table" }
```

**animate: specific instance**
```json
{
  "type": "scene",
  "method": "animate",
  "tangible_id": "bg_animals",
  "params": {
    "event": "draw_bar_guideline",
    "status": "proposed",
    "description": "Guideline draws from top of Monkeys bar to axis",
    "category": "Monkeys"
  }
}
```

**animate: all instances of a type**
```json
{
  "type": "scene",
  "method": "animate",
  "tangible_type": "picture_graph",
  "params": {
    "event": "transform_to_bar_graph",
    "status": "proposed",
    "description": "All picture graphs collapse into bar graphs"
  }
}
```

**update**
```json
{
  "type": "scene",
  "method": "update",
  "tangible_id": "bg_colors",
  "params": {
    "highlight_categories": ["Blue", "Yellow"],
    "description": "Blue and Yellow bars highlight."
  }
}
```

`params.description` is required on every `update` beat — plain English of what visually changes. Include any additional toy-specific state fields alongside it.

**add**
```json
{
  "type": "scene",
  "method": "add",
  "tangible_id": "numline_a",
  "tangible_type": "number_line",
  "params": { "min": 0, "max": 2 }
}
```

**remove**
```json
{ "type": "scene", "method": "remove", "tangible_id": "numline_a" }
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | `"scene"` | yes | |
| `method` | string | yes | `show` `hide` `animate` `update` `add` `remove` |
| `tangible_id` | string | conditional | Instance ID. Required for `add`. Omit to broaden scope to type or all. |
| `tangible_type` | string | conditional | Required for `add`. Omit to broaden scope to all instances on screen. |
| `params` | object | no | Method-specific configuration; omit when not needed |

---

### Dialogue

Narration or teacher speech. Editable in Notion (💬 callout).

```json
{
  "type": "dialogue",
  "text": "You made a graph with your Minis' votes. Each picture stands for one vote."
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "dialogue",
  "text": "Here's a graph: animals at the zoo. Every picture graph has a key that tells you what each symbol means.",
  "tags": ["vocabulary"]
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | `"dialogue"` | yes | |
| `text` | string | yes | Spoken/displayed text |
| `tags` | string[] | no | Semantic labels, e.g. `["vocabulary"]` |

---

### Prompt

Student interaction point. Text is editable in Notion (❔ callout).

**Workspace tool: single tangible**
```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "Which fruit got the most votes? Click it.",
  "tool": "click_category",
  "target": "pg_fruits",
  "validator": [...]
}
```

**Workspace tool: specific component**
```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "Click on the part that tells us what each symbol means.",
  "tool": "click_component",
  "target": "picture_graph_animals.key",
  "validator": [...]
}
```

**Workspace tool: explicit list of tangibles**
```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "Which graph shows the most cats?",
  "tool": "click_tangible",
  "target": ["pg_fruits", "pg_animals", "pg_pets"],
  "validator": [...]
}
```

**Workspace tool: all tangibles of a type**
```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "Which graph shows the most cats?",
  "tool": "click_tangible",
  "target": { "type": "picture_graph" },
  "validator": [...]
}
```

**Overlay tool**: generates its own UI, no tangible target.
```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "How many monkeys are at the zoo?",
  "tool": "multiple_choice",
  "options": [5, 6, 7, 8],
  "validator": [...]
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "text": "Select all the categories you need to answer this question.",
  "tool": "multi_select",
  "options": ["Dogs", "Cats", "Fish", "Birds", "Lizards"],
  "validator": [...]
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | `"prompt"` | yes | |
| `text` | string | yes | Question or instruction shown to student |
| `tool` | string | yes | `click_category` · `click_component` · `click_tangible` · `multiple_choice` · `multi_select` |
| `target` | string \| string[] \| object | conditional | What the tool acts on. Omit for overlay tools. See shapes below. |
| `options` | array | conditional | Overlay tools only: `multiple_choice` and `multi_select`. Numbers or strings. |
| `validator` | array | yes | See [Validator](#validator) |

**`target` shapes:**

| Shape | When to use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `"tangible_id"` | Single tangible instance | `"target": "picture_graph_fruits"` |
| `"tangible_id.component"` | Specific component within a tangible | `"target": "picture_graph_animals.key"` |
| `["id1", "id2"]` | Explicit list of selectable instances | `"target": ["pg_fruits", "pg_animals"]` |
| `{ "type": "..." }` | All instances of a tangible type | `"target": { "type": "picture_graph" }` |

---

### current_scene

Always the last beat in every step group. It is a pure derived snapshot: it reflects only what `scene` beats have established. Within a section, tangibles carry forward step to step — a tangible stays on screen until a `scene` beat removes or hides it. `current_scene` never introduces new tangibles or state that no `scene` beat has declared.

```json
{
  "type": "current_scene",
  "elements": [
    {
      "tangible_id": "picture_graph_fruits",
      "description": "Horizontal picture graph. Favorite Fruits data. Apples row highlighted.",
      "tangible_type": "picture_graph",
      "mode": "reading",
      "orientation": "horizontal",
      "categories": ["Apples", "Bananas", "Oranges", "Grapes"]
    }
  ]
}
```

If the screen is empty, write `"elements": []`.

---

### empty

Used in validator state `beats` arrays to signal that no feedback is needed for this state. Preferred over an empty array (`[]`) because it makes the intent explicit — this state is intentionally silent, not accidentally incomplete.

```json
{ "type": "empty" }
```

Only valid inside validator state `beats`. Not used in outer section beats.

---

## Validator

A flat array of states evaluated **in order**; the first match wins. The final state is always an empty condition (`{}`) catch-all. Each state contains inline `beats`, which play when the state matches.

Every state must include `is_correct: true` or `is_correct: false`. `incorrect_count` is the one system parameter; all other condition keys are tangible-specific fields.

```json
"validator": [
  {
    "condition": { "selected": "Apples" },
    "description": "Student selected Apples",
    "is_correct": true,
    "beats": [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "animate", "tangible_id": "pg_fruits",
        "params": { "event": "highlight_category", "status": "confirmed",
                    "description": "Apples row highlights to confirm selection", "category": "Apples" } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "Apples got 6 votes, the most of any fruit." },
      { "type": "current_scene", "elements": [ { "tangible_id": "pg_fruits", "description": "Apples row highlighted.", "tangible_type": "picture_graph" } ] }
    ]
  },
  {
    "condition": { "incorrect_count": 1 },
    "description": "Student selected any wrong answer on first attempt",
    "is_correct": false,
    "beats": [
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "Look at the numbers next to each row. Which one is biggest?" },
      { "type": "current_scene", "elements": [ { "tangible_id": "pg_fruits", "description": "Picture graph unchanged.", "tangible_type": "picture_graph" } ] }
    ]
  },
  {
    "condition": { "incorrect_count": 2 },
    "description": "Student selected any wrong answer on second attempt",
    "is_correct": false,
    "beats": [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "update", "tangible_id": "pg_fruits",
        "params": { "highlight_categories": ["Apples"], "description": "Apples row highlights." } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "Count the Apples row: 6 symbols. Count the others: Bananas 4, Oranges 5, Grapes 3. Which row has the most?" },
      { "type": "current_scene", "elements": [ { "tangible_id": "pg_fruits", "description": "Apples row highlighted.", "tangible_type": "picture_graph" } ] }
    ]
  },
  {
    "condition": {},
    "description": "Catch-all: any remaining state",
    "is_correct": false,
    "beats": [
      { "type": "scene", "method": "update", "tangible_id": "pg_fruits",
        "params": { "highlight_categories": ["Apples"], "description": "Apples row highlights." } },
      { "type": "dialogue", "text": "Apples has 6 symbols, more than any other row. Click Apples." },
      { "type": "current_scene", "elements": [ { "tangible_id": "pg_fruits", "description": "Apples row highlighted.", "tangible_type": "picture_graph" } ] }
    ]
  }
]
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `condition` | object | Matching condition. Multiple keys implicitly ANDed. Use `or`/`and` arrays for explicit logic. |
| `description` | string | Precise plain-English description of exactly what student state this condition captures. |
| `is_correct` | boolean | **Required.** `true` if this state represents a correct student response, `false` otherwise. |
| `beats` | array | Flat array of beats to play when this state matches. Same structure as section `beats`. |

### Condition Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `selected` | string \| number | What the student selected from the tool's available options |
| `incorrect_count` | number | System counter: how many times the student has triggered a non-first-match state on this prompt. Max 3. |
| `tangible_id` | string | Scopes remaining keys to a specific tangible instance. Used when checking tangible state fields directly. |
| *(tangible fields)* | any | State fields exposed by the scoped tangible, used alongside `tangible_id` |

### Condition Logic

**Single tangible check:**
```json
{ "condition": { "selected": "Bananas", "incorrect_count": 1 } }
```

**Specific tangible field check:**
```json
{ "condition": { "tangible_id": "numline_a", "shaded_interval_count": 3 } }
```

**Multiple tangibles (AND):**
```json
{
  "condition": {
    "and": [
      { "tangible_id": "bar_a", "points": [1, 2] },
      { "tangible_id": "numline_a", "shaded_interval_count": 3 }
    ]
  }
}
```

**OR across values:**
```json
{ "condition": { "or": [{ "selected": "Oranges" }, { "selected": "Grapes" }] } }
```

**Fallback: empty object; always matches:**
```json
{}
```

## Remediation Pattern

Remediation is inline. Feedback beats live directly in validator states, not in separate sections. The three-level scaffold maps to `incorrect_count` values:

| Validator state | Hint style |
|---|---|
| `incorrect_count: 1` | Light: minimal nudge, direct attention without revealing the answer |
| `incorrect_count: 2` | Medium: partial reveal, show the key data, let the student conclude |
| catch-all `{}` | Heavy: full scaffold, state the answer explicitly, prompt to confirm |

Each state's `beats` contains the beats for that hint level. See the [Validator](#validator) section for a full example.

---

## Tangible ID Conventions

Tangible ID prefixes and naming patterns are defined in the toy spec files (`toy_specs/`). Consult the relevant toy spec for the canonical prefix and any instance-naming rules for that toy type.

---

## Beat Summary

| Type | Notion format | Editable | Fields |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scene` | 🎬 callout | no | `method`, `tangible_id`, `params?` |
| `dialogue` | 💬 callout | yes: `text` | `text`, `tags?` |
| `prompt` | ❔ callout | yes: `text` | `text`, `tool`, `options?`, `validator` |
| `current_scene` | 📋 toggle | no | `elements` |
| `empty` | plain text suffix | no | — (validator beats only) |
