## CONCEPTS EXPLICITLY TAUGHT

1. **Counting sequence to b/b** — 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4 pattern shows iteration to whole  
2. **b/b \= 1 pattern** — "When numerator equals denominator, the fraction equals 1"  
3. **Pattern holds across denominators** — 4/4 \= 1, 6/6 \= 1 (same position, same value)  
4. **2b/b \= 2 extension** — 8/4 \= 2 (counting continues past 1\)  
5. **Writing wholes as fractions** — "We can write 1 as 3/3 or 2 as 6/3"  
6. **Reverse engineering** — Given 1/4, find where 4/4 (= 1\) is; Given 3/5, find where 1 is  
7. **Vocabulary formalized** — "numerator equals denominator"

## LEARNING GOALS

**L1 (Verbatim):** "Represent whole numbers on number lines given a unit fraction; write whole numbers as fractions."

**L2 (Verbatim):** "Locate 1 given the location of a non-unit fraction; infer the unit size and denominator."

**Module Focus:** FORMALIZATION of patterns discovered in M6. Students learn to articulate WHY b/b \= 1, develop BIDIRECTIONAL fluency (whole → fraction AND fraction → whole), and master the REVERSE task (finding 1 from a partial fraction).

---

## MASTERY ASSUMPTION

**Students entering M7 have MASTERED (from M6):**

- Placing any fraction by counting intervals from zero ✓  
- Placing fractions \> 1 on extended number lines ✓  
- Placing multiple fractions in sequence ✓  
- Understanding that denominator stays constant past 1 ✓  
- Identifying fractions from points on the line ✓

**Therefore, M7 Practice does NOT need standalone procedural templates for:**

- ~~Place b/b at position 1~~ (they can already place any fraction)  
- ~~Place 2b/b at position 2~~ (they can already place fractions \> 1\)  
- ~~Place sequence crossing b/b~~ (they can already place sequences)

**M7 Practice focuses on what's GENUINELY NEW:**

1. **Conceptual:** FORMALIZING the b/b \= 1 pattern (why, not just how)  
2. **Transfer (Forward):** Writing whole numbers AS fractions (bidirectional)  
3. **Transfer (Reverse):** Finding 1 when given only a fraction (inversion of M6 skills)

## COMPONENT A: CONCEPTUAL (35-40%)

*What students UNDERSTAND — formalizing patterns*

---

### M7-01: Recognize that b/b \= 1 (numerator equals denominator means one whole)

**Builds on:** M6-04 — Denominator stays constant; M6-06 — Recognize fractions \> 1  
**What's New:** NAMING the pattern explicitly — "when numerator equals denominator, the fraction equals 1"

**Lesson Alignment:** Step 6 MCQ — "What makes 4/4 and 6/6 equal 1?" → "The numerator equals the denominator"

**What It Looks Like:** Student identifies which fractions equal 1 from a set; selects correct pattern description.

**Verbs:** identify  
**Tiers:** confidence, support, baseline  
**Templates:** 7001, 7002

---

### M7-02: Explain WHY b/b \= 1 using "all parts make a whole" reasoning

**Builds on:** M7-01 — Recognizing the pattern  
**What's New:** Moving from pattern recognition to conceptual EXPLANATION

**Lesson Alignment:** Step 6 — "4 parts out of 4 total. That's all of them, which equals 1."

**What It Looks Like:** Student selects or demonstrates understanding that b/b means "all b parts out of b total \= everything \= 1 whole."

**Verbs:** identify  
**Tiers:** support, baseline, stretch  
**Templates:** 7003

---

### M7-03: Recognize that 2b/b \= 2 (pattern extends to whole number 2\)

**Builds on:** M7-01 — Understanding b/b \= 1  
**What's New:** Extending the formalized pattern: if b/b \= 1, then 2b/b \= 2

**Lesson Alignment:** Step 7 — "If 4/4 equals 1, where would 8/4 go?"; Step 8 — "2 as 6/3"

**What It Looks Like:** Student identifies that 8/4 \= 2, 6/3 \= 2, 4/2 \= 2; recognizes the doubling pattern.

**Verbs:** identify  
**Tiers:** baseline, stretch  
**Templates:** 7004

---

## COMPONENT B: TRANSFER — FORWARD DIRECTION (25-30%)

*Writing whole numbers AS fractions*

---

### M7-04: Write 1 as a fraction with any given denominator

**Builds on:** M7-01 — Recognizing b/b \= 1  
**What's New:** BIDIRECTIONAL fluency — given "write 1 using sixths," student produces 6/6

**Lesson Alignment:** Step 8 — "We can write 1 as 3/3"; synthesis — "write 1 as 3/3 or 5/5 or 100/100"

**What It Looks Like:** Given a denominator, student selects, drags, or produces the correct b/b fraction.

**Verbs:** create, apply  
**Tiers:** support, baseline, stretch  
**Templates:** 7005, 7006

---

### M7-05: Write 2 as a fraction with any given denominator

**Builds on:** M7-03 — Recognizing 2b/b \= 2; M7-04 — Writing 1 as a fraction  
**What's New:** Same bidirectional task extended to whole number 2

**Lesson Alignment:** Step 8 — "2 as 6/3"

**What It Looks Like:** Given a denominator, student produces the correct 2b/b fraction (e.g., "Write 2 using fourths" → 8/4).

**Verbs:** create, apply  
**Tiers:** baseline, stretch, challenge  
**Templates:** 7007

---

## COMPONENT C: TRANSFER — REVERSE DIRECTION (30-35%)

*Finding 1 from a given fraction — THIS IS THE HARD NEW SKILL*

---

### M7-06: Find 1 on a number line given a unit fraction position

**Builds on:** M6-05 — Identify fraction from point (INVERTED)  
**What's New:** REVERSE direction — given where 1/b is, find where b/b (= 1\) is

**Lesson Alignment:** Step 9 — "If this point is 1/4, where would 4/4 go?"

**What It Looks Like:** Number line shows 0 and a point labeled 1/4. Student places point at position 1 by reasoning "3 more fourths to reach 4/4."

**Verbs:** create, apply  
**Tiers:** support, baseline, stretch  
**Templates:** 7008, 7009

---

### M7-07: Find 1 on a number line given a non-unit fraction position

**Builds on:** M7-06 — Reverse from unit fraction  
**What's New:** HARDER reverse — given a/b where a \> 1, find 1 (requires more inference)

**Lesson Alignment:** Step 10 — "If this is 3/5, where would 1 be?"

**What It Looks Like:** Number line shows 0 and a point labeled 3/5. Student places point at 5/5 \= 1 by reasoning "2 more fifths."

**Verbs:** create, apply  
**Tiers:** baseline, stretch, challenge  
**Templates:** 7010, 7011

---

## COMPONENT D: TRANSFER — CONNECTION (5-10%)

*Linking representations — emerging skill for Module 7-9 stage*

---

### M7-08: Connect b/b \= 1 pattern across multiple representations

**NEW:** First appearance of cross-representation connection for this concept  
**Rationale:** M7 is in Modules 7-9 range where `connect` verb emerges (5-10% target)

**Lesson Alignment:** Step 6 shows two number lines (fourths and sixths) with same position for 1

**What It Looks Like:** Student sees 4/4 on one line and 6/6 on another; identifies that both equal 1 / both land at same position / recognizes the pattern holds regardless of denominator.

**Verbs:** connect, compare  
**Tiers:** stretch, challenge  
**Templates:** 7012
