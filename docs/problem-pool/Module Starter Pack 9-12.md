# **MODULE 9: EQUIVALENT FRACTIONS (ABSTRACT) \- SCRIPT STARTER PACK**

## **MODULE 9 SCOPE FENCE 🚧**

**JUST THIS:**

* Identifying equivalent fractions as same point on number line  
* Recognizing which fractions equal whole numbers (b/b \= 1, 2b/b \= 2\)  
* Understanding position determines equivalence (not just visual area)  
* Applying "same point" concept to fractions ≤ 1 primarily  
* Express whole numbers as fractions (4/4 \= 1, 6/6 \= 1, 8/8 \= 1\)

**NOT THIS:**

* Converting improper fractions to mixed numbers (Module 10+)  
* Writing 3/2 as 1½ (Later modules)  
* Comparing non-equivalent fractions with \< or \> (Module 10\)  
* Division relationships (8/4 \= 8 ÷ 4\) (Grade 4\)  
* Systematic simplification algorithms (Later modules)  
* Cross-multiplication or finding common denominators (Grade 4\)

**THE TRAP TO AVOID:** When students see 3/2 and 6/4 at the same point, they might want to convert to 1½. DON'T. We're only showing position equivalence. Similarly, when 8/4 \= 2, don't explore "how many 4s in 8?" Stay focused on position. Also avoid teaching symbolic patterns like "multiply both by 2."

**PEDAGOGICAL COMMITMENT:** Abstract thinking through position, with careful scaffolding. Single line before stacked. Fractions ≤ 1 before \> 1\. Recognition before generation. Process between discoveries. Visual proof remains primary \- position is another form of visual proof.

### **PEDAGOGICAL COMMITMENT:**

Abstract thinking through position, with careful scaffolding. Single line before stacked. Fractions ≤ 1 before \> 1\. Recognition before generation. Process between discoveries.

## **9.0 MODULE PROGRESSION CONTEXT**

**From Module 8:** Students can identify equivalent fractions through visual matching (same size/area) with concrete models

**This Module (Lessons 12 & 13 Combined):** Students discover equivalent fractions as same position on number line and recognize fractions equivalent to whole numbers

**To Module 10:** This prepares students for more symbolic work with equivalence and systematic generation of equivalent fractions

### **Continuity Notes:**

* Bridge from Module 8: "You proved 1/2 \= 2/4 by matching their size. Now let's prove it by matching their position."  
* Bridge to Module 10: "Now you can identify fractions at the same point (equal). Next, you'll compare fractions at different points (unequal)."  
* **Key Connection:** Module 9 confirms Module 8's equivalence on number lines AND extends to whole numbers  
* Vocabulary progression: \[same size, equivalent\] → \[same point, equivalent to whole number\] → \[greater than, less than\]

## **9.1 LEARNING GOALS (VERBATIM):**

Lesson 12: "Identify and generate equivalent fractions as the same point on a number line."

Lesson 13: "Express whole numbers as fractions and recognize fractions equivalent to whole numbers."

## **9.2 CORE CONCEPTS:**

"Equivalence via position on number line"

## **9.3 STANDARDS:**

Lesson 12: Building On: 3.NF.A.2 / Addressing: 3.NF.A.3a, 3.NF.A.3b / Building Toward: 3.NF.A.3d

Lesson 13: Building On: 3.NF.A.2, 3.NF.A.3a / Addressing: 3.NF.A.3c / Building Toward: 3.NF.A.3d

## **9.4 MISCONCEPTIONS TO ADDRESS:**

**\#4 \- Improper Spacing on Number Line:** "Spacing units unevenly or inconsistently" 

**\#7 \- Difficulty Recognizing Equivalence:** "Not seeing that 2/4 \= 1/2, even when visually aligned" 

**\#10 \- Overgeneralizing Rules:** "Thinking 'bigger denominator \= smaller piece' means 2/4 \< 1/2"

## **9.5 REMEDIATION LANGUAGE:**

### **TARGETED MISCONCEPTION RESPONSES (When specific error detected):**

**For Misconception \#4 (Spacing Errors):** \[Misconception\_\#4\]: "You're getting close. When we mark fourths, each one needs the same distance. Want to use the whole length as a guide?" 

**For Misconception \#7 (Difficulty Recognizing Equivalence):** \[Misconception\_\#7\]: "On the number line, equivalent fractions land on the exact same point\! Look \- 1/2 and 2/4 both land right here, halfway to 1\. Different names for the same location."

**For Misconception \#10 (Overgeneralizing Rules):** \[Misconception\_\#10\]: "Don't assume bigger denominator means smaller value\! Yes, fourths are smaller pieces than halves, but 2/4 uses TWO fourths, which equals 1/2. Check the actual position, not just the denominator."

### **GENERAL ERROR PROGRESSION (When misconception unclear):**

**Light (First Error \- 10-20 words):** "Do these fractions land on the same point?"

**Medium (Second Error \- 25-35 words):** "You're getting there. Even though 4 is bigger than 2, the fractions 2/4 and 1/2 land at the same spot \- halfway to 1."

**Heavy (Third Error \- 40-60 words):** \[Modeling\] "Watch the number line: 1/2 lands here at the halfway mark. Now count 2/4 \- one fourth, two fourths \- it lands at the exact same point\! Different fractions, same position. See how that works?."

**Exit Transition:** "You learned that equivalent fractions share the same point on a number line. Next time, we'll explore what happens when fractions DON'T share the same point."

## **9.11 IDENTITY CLOSURE EXAMPLE:**

"You discovered that equivalent fractions don't just look the same size \- they land at the exact same point on a number line. When you recognize that 4/4, 6/6, and 8/8 all equal 1, you're thinking abstractly like a mathematician. From concrete to abstract \- what a leap\!"

You're absolutely right\! Let me revise Module 9.20B following the proper template structure while incorporating all the fixes:

## **9.20B PATH B (SINGAPORE) PHASE-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE**

\[SOURCE: Visualizations.xlsx Singapore Path tab \+ Module scripts\]

**Path Philosophy:** Systematic progression from concrete to abstract using consistent bar model with number line support 

**Module Progression:** From Module 8's visual equivalence to position-based equivalence using dual representation 

**Bridge from Module 8:** "You proved 1/2 \= 2/4 using bars and lines. Today, we'll use both tools systematically to understand equivalence."

VERIFICATION AFTER WRITING: □ All activities above included? Count: \_\_\_ □ All fractions used? List: \_\_\_ □ All strategies taught? List: \_\_\_ □ Misconceptions addressed? \#***, \#***, \#\_\_\_

## **SCOPE CONTROL CHECKPOINT**

**BEFORE SUBMITTING, ASK YOURSELF:**

1. Would an SME say "When did we teach that?" → No mixed numbers, no division reasoning  
2. Could this module stand alone without the next one? → Yes, position equivalence is complete  
3. Are there any "aha moments" about relationships? → Position only, not operational patterns  
4. Does Practice test anything beyond the one core skill? → Just position equivalence (including to wholes)  
5. Does Synthesis teach new concepts? → No, only consolidates position thinking

**The One Thing:** Students learn that equivalent fractions land at the same point on a number line, including fractions that equal whole numbers.

**Not These Things:** Mixed number conversion, simplification algorithms, division relationships, comparison of non-equivalent fractions.

### **PEDAGOGICAL FLOW CHECK**

**Cognitive Load:**

* Warm-up: Light (pattern recognition)  
* Lesson: Moderate-Heavy (new abstraction)  
* Exit Check: Moderate (application)  
* Practice: Moderate (varied contexts)  
* Synthesis: Light-Moderate (generalization)

**Pacing:**

* Total module: \~30 minutes  
* Appropriate for conceptual breakthrough  
* Balanced discovery and practice

**Scaffolding:**

1. Review area equivalence  
2. Discover position equivalence  
3. Apply to whole numbers  
4. Limited extension beyond 1  
5. Generate in Practice  
6. Generalize in Synthesis

# **MODULE 10: COMPARE LIKE DENOMINATORS \- SCRIPT STARTER PACK**

## **MODULE 10 SCOPE FENCE 🚧**

### **JUST THIS:**

* Comparing fractions with the SAME denominator only  
* Using \>, \<, \= symbols with visual justification. Help kids to understand the symbols.  
* Understanding "more parts of the same size \= larger fraction"  
* Ordering multiple fractions with same denominator

### **NOT THIS:**

* Comparing fractions with different denominators (Module 11+)  
* Cross-multiplication or finding common denominators (Grade 4\)  
* Benchmark fractions like 1/2 for comparison (Module 11\)  
* Adding or subtracting fractions (Unit 6\)  
* Converting to decimals for comparison (Grade 4\)

### **THE TRAP TO AVOID:**

When students see 3/4 \> 2/4, they might generalize "bigger numerator always means bigger fraction." DON'T LET THEM. Always emphasize "SAME denominator" as the condition. Also avoid "3 is bigger than 2" without "3 fourths is bigger than 2 fourths."

### **PEDAGOGICAL COMMITMENT:**

Visual reasoning before symbols. Same denominator throughout. Parts thinking, not number thinking. Every comparison must reference the visual model.

### **10.0 MODULE PROGRESSION CONTEXT**

**From Module 9:** Students understand equivalent fractions as same point on number line and can identify fractions equal to whole numbers

**This Module (Lesson 14 Only):** Students compare fractions with the same denominator using comparison symbols with visual justification

**To Module 11:** This prepares students to compare fractions with different denominators using benchmark reasoning and visual models

### **Continuity Notes:**

* Bridge from Module 9: "You made a great discovery \- fractions at the same point are equal\! Now let's explore what happens when fractions land at different points..."  
* Bridge to Module 11: "You've become good at comparing fractions with the same denominators\! Next time, we'll discover interesting patterns when numerators match instead."  
* **Key Connection:** Uses Module 9's number line work AND Module 8's visual reasoning  
* **Building On:** Students know 4/4 \= 1, so 3/4 \< 1 and 5/4 \> 1 (use as reference points)  
* Vocabulary progression: \[equivalent, same point\] → \[greater than, less than, compare\] → \[benchmark, common denominator\]

## **10.1 LEARNING GOALS (VERBATIM):**

"Compare fractions with the same denominator using \>, \<, \= and justify with visual models."

## **10.2 CORE CONCEPTS:**

"Same denominator comparison through visual reasoning"

## **10.3 STANDARDS:**

Building On: 3.NF.A.1, 3.NF.A.2 

Addressing: 3.NF.A.3d 

Building Toward: 4.NF.A.2

## **10.4 MISCONCEPTIONS TO ADDRESS:**

**\#8 \- Errors Comparing Unlike Fractions:** "Believing larger denominator \= larger fraction" 

**\#10 \- Overgeneralizing Rules:** "Applying rules like 'larger number \= bigger piece' across contexts"

## **10.5 REMEDIATION LANGUAGE:**

### **TARGETED MISCONCEPTION RESPONSES (When specific error detected):**

**For Misconception \#8 (Comparison Errors):** \[Misconception\_\#8\]: "When denominators match, comparing is simple \- just look at numerators\! With 3/5 and 2/5, we have the same size pieces (fifths), so 3 pieces is more than 2 pieces. Bigger numerator means bigger fraction here."

**For Misconception \#10 (Overgeneralization):** \[Misconception\_\#10\]: "This rule only works when denominators are the SAME. You can't use this strategy to compare 3/5 with 3/7 \- that needs different thinking. Same denominators first, then compare numerators."

### **GENERAL ERROR PROGRESSION (When misconception unclear):**

**Light (First Error \- 10-20 words):** "When denominators match, which numerator is bigger?"

**Medium (Second Error \- 25-35 words):** "You're working through it. Since both fractions have 8 as denominator, we're comparing same-size pieces. Which has more pieces \- 5/8 or 3/8?"

**Heavy (Third Error \- 40-60 words):** \[Modeling\] "Let me demonstrate: Both fractions use eighths \- same size pieces. Now I count: 5/8 has five pieces, 3/8 has three pieces. Five is more than three, so 5/8 \> 3/8. You are going to get this, let’s keep trying"

## **10.20C PATH C (VPSS) PHASE-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE \- REVISION WITH PATTERN TILES**

**Path Philosophy:** Visual-spatial comparison starting with pattern tiles, transitioning to grid counting **Module Progression:** From Module 9's equivalence to comparison using concrete tiles first **Bridge from Module 9:** "Equal fractions land at the same point. Now let's compare fractions that DON'T equal." **Required Coverage:** Same-denominator comparison only, using tiles then grids **Conceptual Bridge:** Pattern tiles show "more pieces" concretely before grid counting **Pedagogical Note:** Tiles provide clearer initial comparison than grids

**Setup Rules:**

"Today we compare fractions from IDENTICAL shapes"

- "Same denominator AND same whole"  
- Every comparison shows two identical base shapes  
- "Why? Different shapes \= different amounts"

  #### **WARM-UP:**

**Setup:** Two identical circles showing 2/8 and 5/8 as pizza slices **Actions:**

1. "Which pizza has more slices eaten?"  
2. Count slices in each  
3. "5 slices is more than 2 slices

**Conceptual Purpose:** Activate comparison through concrete tiles

**Bridge Language:** "You can see or count which has more pieces"

**Guide Language Examples:**

* "Count the tiles in each"  
* "More tiles means larger fraction"  
* "Same size tiles makes comparison easy"

  #### **LESSON:**

**Setup:** Pattern tiles transitioning to grid arrays **Actions:** Compare concretely, then add symbols

**Activity Flow:**

1. **Tile Comparison (2 min):**  
   * 3/8 tiles vs 5/8 tiles  
   * "Count the eighth-tiles"  
   * "5 eighth-tiles is more than 3"  
2. **Transition to Grids (1.5 min):**  
   * Same comparison in grid form  
   * "Grids show the same thing."  
3. Circle Comparison:  
   * 3/8 vs 5/8 of pizza  
   * "Count the slices."  
4. Same denominator \= same size slices  
5. Hexagon Comparison:  
   * 2/6 vs 4/6 using triangles  
   * Visual counting in pattern blocks  
6. **Symbol Introduction (2 min):** \[Vocabulary\_Staging\] "5/8 \> 3/8 means GREATER THAN"  
7. **Practice Both Tools (2.5 min):**  
   * Compare with tiles  
   * Verify with grids  
   * Write symbols

**Visual Affordances:** Tiles more concrete than grids initially

#### **PRACTICE:**

**Component Breakdown:**

* Circle comparisons: 35%  
* Pattern block comparisons: 35%  
* Rectangle comparisons: 30%

**Problem Sequence:**

1. Compare 3/8 vs 5/8 (identical circles)  
2. Compare 2/6 vs 5/6 (identical hexagons)  
3. Order: 1/4, 3/4, 2/4 (same rectangle)  
4. Compare 3/8 vs 6/8 (same circle)  
5. Which hexagon has more shaded? (same size)  
6. Student choice: Pick shape, compare fractions

**Critical Rule:** All comparisons use identical shapes/sizes

**Guide Language Examples:**

* Light: "Count the shaded parts"  
* Medium: "Remember \- same size pieces, different amounts" \[Visual Aid\]  
* Heavy: \[Modeling\] "Watch: 3 fourths in this grid, 2 fourths in that grid. 3 \> 2, so 3/4 \> 2/4"

**Required Tags:** \[Meta\_Remediation\], \[Transfer\_Thinking\], \[System\_Leverage\] **Visual Affordances:** Multiple representations available **Target Misconceptions:** Focus on \#8 and \#10 **Symbols:** Integrated with visuals **Flexibility Notes:** Encourage tool switching for verification

#### **SYNTHESIS:**

**Setup:** Display showing grids and number lines with various comparisons  
**Actions:** Explain why comparison works, order multiple fractions  
**Conceptual Purpose:** Generalize comparison reasoning  
**Transfer Questions:**

* "Why can we compare these fractions?"  
* "What has to be the same?"  
* "How do grids help us compare?"  
* "How does the number line confirm it?"

**Guide Language Examples:**

* "You discovered the rule \- same denominators means we can count."  
* "The grids show amount, the line shows position"  
* "Explain your comparison strategy"

**Required Tags:** \[Meta\_Prompt\], \[Identity\_Builder\], \[Transfer\_Thinking\] **Visual Affordances:** All tools visible simultaneously **Risks to Avoid:** Don't lose the visual reasoning **Target Misconceptions:** Solidifying understanding **Symbols:** Connected to visual meaning **Flexibility Notes:** Celebrate different explanation approaches **Identity Moment:** \[Identity\_Builder\] "You can SEE which fraction is greater."

### **10.21 CONNECTIONS TO MODULES 8-9**

**Essential References:**

- "Not equivalent means one is greater or less" (builds on Module 8\)  
- "Different positions on the line means different values" (builds on Module 9\)  
- "Use 1 as a benchmark: Is this fraction more or less than 4/4?" (uses Module 9\)

**Do NOT:**

- Forget to reference equivalence as the foundation  
- Lose number line representation completely  
- Skip the connection between equal and unequal

## **SCOPE CONTROL CHECKPOINT**

**BEFORE SUBMITTING, ASK YOURSELF:**

1. Would an SME say "When did we teach that?" → No different denominator comparison  
2. Could this module stand alone without the next one? → Yes, same-denominator comparison is complete  
3. Are there any "aha moments" about relationships? → Just "more parts \= larger" for same denominator  
4. Does Practice test anything beyond the one core skill? → Only same-denominator comparison  
5. Does Synthesis teach new concepts? → No, only reinforces same-denominator rule

**The One Thing:** Students learn to compare fractions WITH THE SAME DENOMINATOR using \>, \<, and \= symbols with visual justification.

**Not These Things:** Different denominator comparison, benchmark reasoning, common denominators, fraction arithmetic.

## **PEDAGOGICAL FLOW CHECK**

### **Cognitive Load:**

* Warm-up: Light (visual only)  
* Lesson: Moderate (symbols added gradually)  
* Exit Check: Moderate (apply symbols)  
* Practice: Moderate-Heavy (ordering added)  
* Synthesis: Moderate (generalization)

### **Pacing:**

* Total module: \~30 minutes  
* Single concept throughout  
* Appropriate for one lesson

### **Scaffolding:**

1. Visual comparison first  
2. Add comparison language  
3. Introduce symbols  
4. Practice with symbols  
5. Extend to ordering

This module is tightly focused and should be very achievable for students who have mastered equivalence.

* Benchmark reasoning with 1/2 (Module 12\)  
* Cross-multiplication (Grade 4+)  
* Symbolic comparison without visual support

### **THE TRAP TO AVOID:**

When students see 1/4 vs 1/8 (same numerator), they might think "8 is bigger than 4, so 1/8 is bigger." DON'T LET THIS PERSIST. Always return to visual: "Look at the actual size of one-eighth versus one-fourth."

### **PEDAGOGICAL COMMITMENT:**

Visual reasoning throughout. Every comparison must reference the model. Build from same denominator (review) to same numerator (new insight). Process between discoveries.

## **11.0 MODULE PROGRESSION CONTEXT**

**From Module 10:** Students can compare fractions with the same denominator using \>, \<, \= symbols with visual justification

**This Module (Lessons 15 & 16 Combined):** Students reinforce same-denominator comparison with visual extension (Lesson 15\) and learn to compare same-numerator fractions through piece size reasoning (Lesson 16\)

**To Module 12:** This prepares students for comparing fractions with different denominators using benchmarks and symbolic reasoning

### **Continuity Notes:**

* Bridge from Module 10: "You compared fractions with same denominators. Let's extend that visually and explore what happens with same numerators."  
* Bridge to Module 12: "You can compare when something matches. Next, you'll compare when nothing matches using benchmarks."  
* **Key Connection:** Uses Module 10's comparison symbols WITH new visual insights  
* **Building On:** Students understand piece size from denominator work (Modules 4-6)  
* Vocabulary progression: \[same denominator comparison\] → \[piece size reasoning, same numerator\] → \[benchmark comparison\]

## **11.1 LEARNING GOALS (VERBATIM):**

"Reinforce comparison of fractions with the same denominator (visual extension)." (Lesson 15\) "Compare fractions with the same numerator using visuals; reason about piece size." (Lesson 16\)

## **11.2 CORE CONCEPTS:**

"Visual comparison, 'same parts' logic"

## **11.3 STANDARDS:**

Building On: 3.NF.A.1, 3.NF.A.2 

Addressing: 3.NF.A.3d 

Building Toward: 4.NF.2

## **11.4 MISCONCEPTIONS TO ADDRESS:**

**\#8 \- Comparison errors:** "Believing larger denominator \= larger fraction" 

**\#10 \- Overgeneralizing:** "Thinking comparison rules work the same for all situations"

## **11.5 REMEDIATION LANGUAGE:**

### **TARGETED MISCONCEPTION RESPONSES (When specific error detected):**

**For Misconception \#8 (Comparison Errors):** \[Misconception\_\#8\]: "When numerators match, smaller denominator means BIGGER pieces\! Think about pizza \- 3/4 means 3 slices of a pizza cut into 4 pieces. 3/8 means 3 slices of a pizza cut into 8 pieces. Which gives you more pizza?"

**For Misconception \#10 (Overgeneralization):** \[Misconception\_\#10\]: "Careful \- this is opposite from Module 10\! When NUMERATORS match (not denominators), the smaller denominator wins because the pieces are bigger. Don't mix up the two strategies."

### **GENERAL ERROR PROGRESSION (When misconception unclear):**

**Light (First Error \- 10-20 words):** "When we take 3 pieces, are fourths or eighths bigger?"

**Medium (Second Error \- 25-35 words):** "We have 3 pieces either way. But thirds are bigger pieces than sixths. So 3/3 \> 3/6."

**Heavy (Third Error \- 40-60 words):** \[Modeling\] "Let me show you with bars: Here's 3/4 \- three big pieces. Here's 3/8 \- three smaller pieces. Same count, different sizes. The fourths are bigger, so 3/4 \> 3/8. Smaller denominator, bigger pieces. It’s pk if we need to do this a few times."

## **SCOPE CONTROL CHECKPOINT**

**BEFORE SUBMITTING, ASK YOURSELF:**

1. Would an SME say "When did we teach that?" → No benchmark or common denominator methods  
2. Could this module stand alone without the next one? → Yes, these strategies are complete  
3. Are there any "aha moments" about relationships? → Just the two comparison strategies  
4. Does Practice test anything beyond the one core skill? → Only the two comparison types  
5. Does Synthesis teach new concepts? → No, only consolidates the strategies

**The One Thing:** Students learn TWO comparison strategies \- when denominators match (compare counts) and when numerators match (compare piece sizes).

**Not These Things:** Benchmark comparison, common denominators, comparing when nothing matches.

# 

# **MODULE 12: COMPARE UNLIKE DENOMINATORS \- SCRIPT STARTER PACK**

## **MODULE 12 SCOPE FENCE 🚧**

### **JUST THIS:**

* Comparing fractions with different denominators using benchmark reasoning (Lesson 17\)  
* Applying fraction understanding to real-world contexts and visual patterns (Lesson 18\)  
* Using 1/2 and 1 as benchmark references  
* Justifying comparisons symbolically after visual reasoning  
* Capstone application of all fraction concepts

### **NOT THIS:**

* Finding common denominators algorithmically (Grade 4\)  
* Cross-multiplication (Grade 4+)  
* Converting to decimals for comparison (Grade 4\)  
* Fraction operations (adding, subtracting)  
* New fraction concepts beyond comparison

### **THE TRAP TO AVOID:**

When students see 3/4 vs 2/3, they might try to find a common denominator. DON'T. We use benchmarks and visual reasoning. Also avoid teaching algorithmic rules \- keep it conceptual with visual support.

### **PEDAGOGICAL COMMITMENT:**

Benchmark reasoning with visual support. Real-world connections. Celebration of learning journey. Student explanation and justification emphasized.

## **12.0 MODULE PROGRESSION CONTEXT**

**From Module 11:** Students can compare fractions with same denominators or same numerators using visual piece-size reasoning

**This Module (Lessons 17 & 18 Combined):** Students compare different-denominator fractions using benchmarks (Lesson 17\) and apply fraction understanding to design and explain visual patterns as capstone (Lesson 18\)

**To Grade 4:** This prepares students for more formal fraction work including operations and common denominators

### **Continuity Notes:**

* Bridge from Module 11: "When something matched, comparison was possible. Now let's compare when nothing matches using benchmarks."  
* Bridge to future: "You've mastered fraction foundations through visual reasoning. You're ready for fraction operations."  
* **Key Connection:** Synthesizes all modules but focuses on benchmark comparison  
* **Capstone Element:** Lesson 18 brings together entire unit  
* Vocabulary progression: \[piece size, same parts\] → \[benchmark, justify symbolically\] → \[application, design patterns\]

## **12.1 LEARNING GOALS (VERBATIM):**

"Compare fractions with different denominators using benchmarks (e.g., 1/2) and justify symbolically." (Lesson 17\) "Apply fraction understanding to design and explain visual patterns (capstone)." (Lesson 18\)

## **12.2 CORE CONCEPTS:**

"Cross-denominator reasoning"

## **12.3 STANDARDS:**

Building On: 3.NF.A.3d 

Addressing: 3.NF.A.3d 

Building Toward: 4.NF.2

## **12.4 MISCONCEPTIONS TO ADDRESS:**

**\#8 \- Comparison errors:** "Incorrect strategies for unlike fractions" 

**\#9 \- Fractions Only Exist in Shapes:** “ Not recognizing fractions on number lines or symbols”

**\#10 \- Overgeneralizing:** "Misapplying rules across contexts"

## **12.5 REMEDIATION LANGUAGE:**

### **TARGETED MISCONCEPTION RESPONSES (When specific error detected):**

**For Misconception \#8 (Comparison Strategy Errors):** \[Misconception\_\#8\]: "We can't directly compare different pieces, so we use 1/2 as a benchmark\! Check each fraction: Is it more or less than half? Then compare your answers to see which is bigger."

**For Misconception \#9 (Invalid Operations):** \[Misconception\_\#9\]: "We're comparing, not adding\! Don't combine 3/4 and 2/5. Instead, check each one against 1/2 separately. Is 3/4 more than half? Is 2/5 more than half? That tells you which is bigger."

**For Misconception \#10 (Overgeneralizing):** \[Misconception\_\#10\]: "The strategies from Modules 10-11 only work when something matches. Here, nothing matches between 3/4 and 2/3, so we need our benchmark strategy \- compare both to 1/2 or 1."

### **GENERAL ERROR PROGRESSION (When misconception unclear):**

**Light (First Error \- 10-20 words):** "Use your benchmark \- is each fraction more or less than 1/2?"

**Medium (Second Error \- 25-35 words):** "First check if 3/4 is more than half (yes\!). Then check if 2/5 is more than half (no\!). So 3/4 wins."

**Heavy (Third Error \- 40-60 words):** \[Modeling\] "Watch my benchmark strategy: 3/4 equals 6/8, and half would be 4/8, so 3/4 \> 1/2. Now 2/5 \- half would be 2.5/5, so 2/5 \< 1/2. Since 3/4 \> 1/2 and 2/5 \< 1/2, then 3/4 \> 2/5.That’s it, now you are getting it."

## **SCOPE CONTROL CHECKPOINT**

**BEFORE SUBMITTING, ASK YOURSELF:**

1. Would an SME say "When did we teach that?" → No common denominators or new concepts  
2. Could this module stand alone without the next one? → It's the culmination  
3. Are there any "aha moments" about relationships? → Benchmark strategy plus synthesis  
4. Does Practice test anything beyond learned skills? → Only application of known concepts  
5. Does Synthesis teach new concepts? → No, celebrates journey

**The One Thing:** Students learn to compare any fractions using benchmarks and celebrate their complete fraction understanding.

**Not These Things:** Common denominator algorithms, fraction operations, new concepts.
