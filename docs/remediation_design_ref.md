## SECTION 1: System Architecture Overview

### 1.1 The Simplified Model

**v3 introduces a two-track approach based on question type:**

| Question Type | Remediation Approach | Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Non-MC** (create, shade, place, etc.) | Generic L-M-H only | Error cause often ambiguous; tracking handles patterns |
| **Multiple Choice** | Per-distractor branching | We know exactly which wrong answer; targeted feedback valuable |

**Why This Works:**

- Non-MC errors are noisy—kids click wrong for many reasons
- MC distractors give clear diagnostic signal about thinking
- True misconceptions are caught by pattern tracking, not single-instance diagnosis
- Content volume becomes manageable without sacrificing quality

### 1.2 The Two Systems Working Together

```
IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK (This Document)
├── Non-MC: Generic L-M-H
│   └── Validators tag probable error type (for tracking only)
└── MC: Per-distractor Medium + Heavy
    └── Targeted feedback based on which wrong answer chosen

PATTERN DETECTION (Background)
├── Rolling window tracks misconception indicators
├── Threshold triggers Intervention Activity
└── Intervention queued as next activity
```

### 1.3 Core Principles (Unchanged)

- **Sequential only:** Light → Medium → Heavy (max 3 attempts)
- **Never alternatives:** No "Try X or Y" or "Another way to think about it"
- **Progressive support:** Each level provides meaningfully more help
- **System takeover:** After Heavy, system moves student forward

### 1.4 What Changed from v2

| v2 (Old) | v3 (New) |
| :---- | :---- |
| Three remediation types at each level (Generic, Common Error, Misconception) | Non-MC: Generic only; MC: Per-distractor |
| System detects error type and selects remediation in real-time | Non-MC: No detection needed; MC: Distractor choice is the detection |
| 9-15 remediation pieces per question | 3 pieces (non-MC) or 4-5 pieces (MC) |
| Misconception addressed via targeted immediate feedback | Misconception addressed via Intervention after pattern detected |

---

## SECTION 2: Non-MC Remediation (Generic L-M-H)

### 2.1 Overview

For all non-multiple-choice interactions (shading, partitioning, placing on number lines, dragging, etc.), use **Generic remediation only**.

**The validator still tags the probable error type** for misconception tracking, but the student receives generic feedback regardless of detected error.

### 2.2 Why Generic Works

- Single errors are noisy—we can't reliably diagnose from one mistake
- Pattern detection across multiple opportunities is more accurate
- Reduces content creation burden dramatically
- Interventions (when triggered) provide better conceptual support than in-the-moment micro-corrections

### 2.3 Non-MC Flow

```
Student attempts → Wrong
    ↓
Light Remediation (generic)
    ↓
Student attempts → Wrong
    ↓
Medium Remediation (generic) + Visual scaffold
    ↓
Student attempts → Wrong
    ↓
Heavy Remediation (generic) + Full modeling → Reveals answer
    ↓
System moves forward

[Background: Validator logs probable error type for tracking]
```

### 2.4 Non-MC Structure

**Light (10-20 words):** Brief redirect, no visual **Medium (20-30 words):** Conceptual reminder \+ visual scaffold **Heavy (30-60 words):** Full modeling with \[Modeling\] tag, reveals answer

---

## SECTION 3: MC Remediation (Per-Distractor Branching)

### 3.1 Overview

For multiple choice questions, we know exactly which wrong answer the student chose. Each distractor represents a specific error or misconception, so we can provide **targeted feedback**.

### 3.2 MC Structure

For a 4-option MC question (1 correct \+ 3 distractors):

- **3 Medium remediations** (one per distractor)
- **1 Heavy remediation** (explains the correct answer)

**No Light remediation for MC.** Rationale: If they knew the right answer, they would have picked it. A generic "check your answer" rarely helps when we have specific diagnostic information.

### 3.3 MC Flow

```
Student selects Distractor A → Wrong
    ↓
Medium A (targeted to Distractor A's error) + Visual scaffold
    ↓
Student selects Distractor B → Wrong
    ↓
Medium B (targeted to Distractor B's error) + Visual scaffold
    ↓
Student selects any wrong answer → Wrong
    ↓
Heavy (explains correct answer) + Full modeling
    ↓
System moves forward
```

**Same distractor twice:** Student receives the same Medium again. This provides reinforcement and removes any gaming incentive (no shortcut to Heavy/completion).

### 3.4 MC Distractor Design Principles

Each distractor should represent a **diagnosable error:**

| Distractor Type | Example | Medium Focus |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Numerator/denominator confusion | Selected 4/3 instead of 3/4 | "The numerator tells us how many parts we have, not the total" |
| Counted total instead of shaded | Selected 6/6 when 4/6 shaded | "Count only the shaded parts for the numerator" |
| Ignored equal parts requirement | Selected unequal partition | "For fractions, all parts must be equal size" |
| Whole number thinking | Selected 3 instead of 3/4 | "We need a fraction—the bottom number tells us the size of parts" |

### 3.5 Metacognitive MC Questions

Metacognitive questions ("Which strategy would help?", "What should you check first?") are **highest value for branching**. Each wrong strategy choice reveals specific thinking patterns we can address.

---

## SECTION 4: Light Remediation Language Patterns

**Length:** 10-20 words
**Tone:** Brief and direct
**Visual:** None
**Applies to:** Non-MC interactions only (MC skips Light)

### 4.1 With Error Signal (40-50% of interactions)

Use at beginning of module, after successes, when student might think they're right:

- "Not quite. \[specific guidance\]"
- "Almost. \[specific guidance\]"
- "Let's try again. \[specific guidance\]"
- "Let's look at this problem again."
- "Let's take another look."
- "Let's try that again."
- "Let's look closely—\[specific guidance\]"

### 4.2 Without Error Signal (50-60% of interactions)

Use mid-module, when error is obvious, to avoid repetition:

- Direct guidance with no preamble
- "Check \[specific element\]"
- "Count \[specific element\]"
- "Focus on \[specific element\]"
- Simple imperative statements

### 4.3 Guidance Alternatives to "Remember"

Save "Remember" for Medium/Heavy. At Light level, use:

- "The key is..."
- "Focus on..."
- "Notice that..."
- "Here's what helps..."
- "Check the..."

### 4.4 Light Examples

- "Not quite. Count the shaded parts only."
- "Check the spacing between marks."
- "Focus on equal-sized parts."
- "Let's look closely—which parts are shaded?"
- "Count from zero, not from one."

---

## SECTION 5: Medium Remediation Language Patterns

**Length:** 20-30 words
**Tone:** Acknowledge struggle, collaborative
**Visual:** REQUIRED (from Visual Scaffolds TSV)
**Applies to:** Both Non-MC and MC

### 5.1 Approved Starters (Non-MC)

- "Let's think about this together. \[specific help\]"
- "Here's a hint: \[specific clue\]"
- "You're working on it. Here's what helps: \[specific support\]"
- "You're getting there. The key is \[crucial detail\]"
- "Let's think about this a bit more. \[guidance\]"

### 5.2 MC Medium Structure

For MC, Medium is targeted to the specific distractor chosen:

**Template:**

```
[Medium_Remediation - Distractor_A] [Meta_Remediation]: "[20-30 words addressing why Distractor A is wrong and redirecting thinking]"
[Visual: Scaffold highlighting the specific error]
```

**Example (student chose 6/6 when 4/6 was shaded):**

```
[Medium_Remediation - Distractor_B] [Meta_Remediation]: "You counted all the parts. The numerator only counts the shaded parts—how many are filled in?"
[Visual: Shaded parts pulse/highlight, unshaded parts dim]
```

### 5.3 Medium Examples (Non-MC)

- "Let's think about this together. Four fourths equals 1, then three more fourths gets us to 7/4." \[Visual: Number line with 4/4 marked at 1\]
- "Here's a hint: each fourth stays the same size, even past 1." \[Visual: Equal jumps highlighted\]
- "You're working on it. Count the shaded parts for the top number." \[Visual: Shaded sections pulse\]

### 5.4 "Remember" Usage

- Maximum 2-3 times per entire module
- Medium/Heavy only (never Light)
- Use for genuinely important callbacks to prior learning

---

## SECTION 6: Heavy Remediation Language Patterns

**Length:** 30-60 words
**Tone:** Full support, complete demonstration
**Visual:** REQUIRED (full modeling demonstration)
**Tag:** \[Modeling\] REQUIRED
**Applies to:** Both Non-MC and MC

### 6.1 Approved Opening Language

- "This is tricky, so let's work through it together..."
- "This can be tricky, so let's do it together."
- "Let me show you how this works."
- "Here, let me walk you through this one."
- "Let's work through this step by step..."
- "These can be challenging. Let me show you..."
- "Let me help a bit more."

### 6.2 Heavy Structure (Non-MC)

```
[Heavy_Remediation] [Meta_Remediation] [Modeling]: "[30-60 words with complete step-by-step demonstration]"
[Visual: System demonstrates complete solution]
Guide: "[Post-modeling acknowledgment]"
```

### 6.3 Heavy Structure (MC)

For MC, Heavy explains why the correct answer is right:

```
[Heavy_Remediation] [Meta_Remediation] [Modeling]: "[30-60 words explaining the correct answer and demonstrating the thinking]"
[Visual: Correct answer highlighted with supporting scaffold]
Guide: "[Post-modeling acknowledgment]"
```

### 6.4 Heavy Examples

**Non-MC:** "This is tricky, so let me show you. First, I count the total parts—that's my denominator: 4\. Then I count just the shaded parts—that's my numerator: 3\. So the fraction is 3/4." \[Visual: System highlights total parts, then shaded parts, then shows 3/4\]

**MC:** "Let me show you how to think about this. The question asks which fraction is shown. I count 4 equal parts total—that's the denominator. 3 parts are shaded—that's the numerator. So the answer is 3/4, not 4/3." \[Visual: Correct answer highlighted, visual shows counting sequence\]

---

## SECTION 7: Post-Modeling Language

After Heavy remediation with \[Modeling\], use **only** language that acknowledges assisted success:

### 7.1 Approved Post-Modeling Phrases

- "There we go."
- "See how that works?"
- "It's okay if this is tricky."
- "You're getting it now."
- "Now you understand."
- "That makes sense now, right?"
- "That's it—now you've got it."
- "Good—you understand now."
- "Now you see the pattern."

### 7.2 NEVER Use After Modeling

- ❌ "Perfect\!" (they didn't do it alone)
- ❌ "You figured it out\!" (guide showed them)
- ❌ "Great job\!" (too independent)
- ❌ "Excellent work\!" (overpraises assisted work)

### 7.3 Post-Modeling Transitions

After Heavy remediation, move forward assuming understanding:

- "Let's try another one."
- "Now let's continue."
- "Ready for the next?"
- "Let's keep going."

---

## SECTION 8: Error Signal Strategy

### 8.1 When to Use Error Signals

Use error signals (40-50% of Light remediations) when:

- Beginning of module (establish pattern)
- After successes (clear change signal)
- When student might think they're right
- Ambiguous errors

### 8.2 When to Skip Error Signals

Skip error signals (50-60% of Light remediations) when:

- Error is obvious
- Would cause repetition
- Mid-module routine corrections
- Guidance itself implies error

### 8.3 Variety Requirement

Never repeat the same error signal phrase within 3 interactions. Rotate through:

- "Not quite."
- "Almost."
- "Let's try again."
- "Let's look at this problem again."
- "Let's take another look."

---

## SECTION 9: Misconception Tracking & Intervention Triggers

### 9.1 How Tracking Works

Even though non-MC remediation is generic, **validators tag the probable error type** for every wrong answer. This feeds the misconception tracking system.

```
Student makes error → Generic remediation served
                   → Validator logs: "Probable Misconception #3"
                   → Running count updated

[After phase transition]
System checks: Has any misconception hit threshold?
    YES → Queue Intervention Activity
    NO → Continue normal flow
```

### 9.2 Tracking Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Trigger threshold** | 5 errors (placeholder) | TBD with data |
| **Rolling window** | Last 20 opportunities | Natural decay mechanism |
| **Window spans** | Lesson, Exit Check, Practice, Spiral Review, Test Prep | Cross-activity tracking |
| **Check timing** | Phase transitions | Engineer to confirm feasibility |
| **Post-Intervention threshold** | Window lowers to 15 | Catches continued struggle faster |

### 9.3 What Gets Tracked

**Tracked (feeds Intervention triggers):**

- Misconception indicators (\#1-\#10)
- Tracked per visual type for accuracy
- Combined at misconception level for Intervention trigger

**Not Tracked for Intervention:**

- Common procedural errors (counting mistakes, off-by-one)
- Random/ambiguous errors

### 9.4 Example Tracking Flow

```
Opportunity 1: Error on Rectangle Bar → Validator: Misconception #3 → Count: 1
Opportunity 5: Error on Number Line → Validator: Misconception #3 → Count: 2
Opportunity 9: Error on Rectangle Bar → Validator: Misconception #3 → Count: 3
Opportunity 14: Error on Grid → Validator: Misconception #3 → Count: 4
Opportunity 18: Error on Rectangle Bar → Validator: Misconception #3 → Count: 5 ← THRESHOLD

[At next phase transition]
→ Misconception #3 Intervention queued as next activity
```

---

## SECTION 10: Intervention Activity Overview

### 10.1 What Interventions Are

Intervention Activities are **standalone instructional sequences** that address a specific misconception directly. They sit outside regular modules and slot into the activity queue when triggered.

### 10.2 Intervention Scope

- **\~10 total** (one per misconception)
- **Combines visuals** (not visual-specific)
- **Path-flexible** (may use visuals from multiple paths with worked examples)

### 10.3 Intervention Structure

| Phase | Name | Purpose | Approach |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | **Clarify** | Name the misconception | Metacognitive: "A lot of students think X. Let's look at why that's tricky..." |
| 2 | **Model** | Worked examples | Guide demonstrates across 2-3 examples using multiple visuals |
| 3 | **Confirm** | Independent verification | 2-3 problems student completes independently |

### 10.4 Queue Placement

- Intervention replaces whatever activity would have been next
- Multiple triggers \= multiple Interventions queued with brain breaks between
- Follows existing recess/break logic in Activity Queue

### 10.5 After Intervention

- Rolling window lowers to 15 (from 20\)
- If misconception continues to appear, re-triggers faster
- Alternative: Queue targeted Practice problems before re-triggering full Intervention

## SECTION 11: Remediation by Phase

### 11.1 Requirements by Phase

| Phase | Non-MC Requirement | MC Requirement | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Warmup | Light minimum | Per-distractor Medium \+ Heavy | Heavy if key prior knowledge |
| Lesson | Full L-M-H | Per-distractor Medium \+ Heavy | All interactions |
| Exit Check | Full L-M-H | Per-distractor Medium \+ Heavy | MANDATORY \- gateway phase |
| Practice | Full L-M-H | Per-distractor Medium \+ Heavy | Light only for confidence builders |
| Synthesis | Light minimum | Per-distractor Medium \+ Heavy | Full L-M-H for pattern discovery |
| Challenge | None | None | Assessment mode |

### 11.2 Module Complexity Considerations

**Modules 1-3 (Simple concepts):**

- Light remediation may be sufficient for some interactions
- Simpler language appropriate
- Don't force full L-M-H if unnecessary

**Modules 4-8 (Building complexity):**

- Full L-M-H progression more common
- Can reference earlier module strategies

**Modules 9-12 (Complex concepts):**

- Full L-M-H usually needed
- More nuanced explanations appropriate

**Documentation:** Use \[Pedagogical\_Override\] when reality differs from stated requirements.

---

## APPENDIX: Misconception Reference

### Full Misconception List

| ID | Misconception | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| \#1 | Unequal parts acceptable | Believes fractions don't require equal-sized parts |
| \#2 | Numerator \= total parts | Confuses numerator with denominator |
| \#3 | Fractions aren't numbers | Sees fractions as two separate numbers, not one value |
| \#4 | Larger denominator \= larger fraction | Believes 1/8 \> 1/4 because 8 \> 4 |
| \#5 | Fractions can't be \> 1 | Doesn't understand improper fractions |
| \#6 | Numerator \= denominator for "one whole" | Confusion about unit fractions and wholes |
| \#7 | Position on number line \= numerator only | Ignores denominator when placing fractions |
| \#8 | Different shapes can't show same fraction | Doesn't understand fraction equivalence across representations |
| \#9 | Adding fractions \= adding tops and bottoms | Treats numerator and denominator independently |
| \#10 | Fractions only apply to circles/pizzas | Limited mental model of fraction contexts |

### Tracking by Visual Type

Validators may specify visual context for more precise tracking:

- `Misconception_#3_RectangleBar`
- `Misconception_#3_NumberLine`
- `Misconception_#3_Grid`

These aggregate to the misconception level for Intervention triggers.
