# ABSTRACTED VERSION

## **1.6 WARMUP (2-3 minutes)**

### **Purpose**

Activate recognition of equal vs. unequal parts from Grade 2 experience. Create curiosity about naming equal parts.

### **Parameters**

| Element | Specification |
| :---- | :---- |
| Interactions | 3 (2 identification tasks \+ bridge) |
| Format | Binary/ternary choice from pre-partitioned shapes |
| Student action | Click to select only—no tool manipulation |
| Remediation | Light only (redirect and continue) |
| Tone | Curious, inviting ("What do you notice..." not "Today we will learn...") |

### **Constraints**

| USE | AVOID |
| :---- | :---- |
| "equal," "pieces," "same size," "match" | "partition," "whole," "fraction," "halves," "thirds," "fourths" |
| Pre-partitioned rectangles | Student drawing, shading, or tool use |
| Light remediation | Medium/Heavy remediation |

### **Interaction W.1: Hook \+ First Identification**

**Purpose:** Activate the equal vs. unequal distinction with simplest case (2 parts).

**Visual:** Two pre-partitioned rectangles side by side—one with 2 equal parts, one with 2 unequal parts.

**Task:** Student selects the rectangle with equal parts.

**Key moment:** Hook should create curiosity about the difference before asking student to choose.

**Remediation (Light):** Direct attention to size comparison. "Look at the sizes—are they the same?"

---

### **Interaction W.2: Second Identification**

**Purpose:** Confirm pattern recognition with added complexity (more parts, distractor option).

**Visual:** Three pre-partitioned rectangles:

* One with 4 equal parts (correct answer)
* One with 4 unequal parts (equality distractor)
* One with 3 equal parts (count distractor)

**Task:** Student selects the rectangle with four equal pieces.

**Design note:** The count distractor (3 equal parts) tests whether student attends to BOTH count and equality. If selected, Light remediation redirects to counting first.

**Remediation (Light):** "Count the pieces first. Then check—are they all the same size?"

---

### **Interaction W.3: Bridge to Lesson**

**Purpose:** Create anticipation for Lesson without teaching. Student should *want* to know what comes next.

**Visual:** Keep correct rectangle from W.2 visible.

**Content:** Guide references what student just did (finding equal pieces), then teases that mathematicians have special names and ways to write these.

**No student action**—this is a transition.

**Quality check:** Bridge should create a curiosity gap, not just announce "now we'll do the lesson."

---

### **Verification Checklist**

* Hook creates curiosity in first 15 seconds
* Both identification tasks require judgment (not just clicking)
* At least one distractor tests equality OR count
* Bridge references student's success AND teases what's coming
* No forbidden vocabulary appears
* No tool manipulation by student
* Total time stays under 3 minutes
